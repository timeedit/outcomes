["FCH30306","Food Ingredient Functionality","1MO","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- explain the mechanism of action of techno-functional ingredients;- argue why ingredients with similar chemical structures can have different technofunctionalities;- analyse how ingredient functionality can be influenced by processing;- argue the effect of interactions between different food ingredients under different conditions;- design and conduct experiments to analyse chemical and technofunctional properties of ingredients.- process data obtained from experiments to scientifically report on the results.",""]
