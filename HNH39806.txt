["HNH39806","Hidden Hunger: Micronutrient Deficiencies in Low and Middle Income Countries","5AF","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- recognise and judge the prevalence of micronutrient deficiencies in low and middle income countries (LMIC) as public health problems;- explain the relevant human metabolic processes of micronutrients (iron, vitamin A, iodine and zinc) and how this is affected by common infectious diseases;- measure and interpret basic clinical/biochemical parameters related to micronutrient deficiencies and understand how such measurements can be implemented in the field;- simulate the possible effect of a food-based strategy on micronutrient intake taking into account dietary intake, retention factors and bioavailability;- argue why a certain strategy to alleviate micronutrient malnutrition will be the most efficacious in a given situation based on the available evidence;- develop a study design to assess efficacy of a strategy for improving micronutrient status of a target population.",""]
