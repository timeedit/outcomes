["FPE32306","Food Digestion: Oral and Gastric Structure Breakdown","5AF","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- understand how digestion of structured food takes place in the upperpart of the gastro-intestinal tract, including the mechanical and enzymatic processes and physiology;- understand the effect of food complexity, food interaction and food source variation on the digestion process;- critically evaluate in vivo, in vitro and in silico models/techniques that can be used to investigate ingestion, structure breakdown and gastrointestinal passage behavior;- make simple mathematical digestion models by using the software SMART and use this to evaluate the digestion of different food products;- apply the knowledge on food digestion to design a food product for a specific application e.g. for enhanced satiety, more efficient energy release etc.;- design, carry out and evaluate experiments with in vitro digestion models.",""]
