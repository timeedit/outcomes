["LAR36806","Climate-responsive Planning and Design","2AF","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- understand the basic scientific knowledge about energy flows and processes governing the urban climate;- explain methods for energy consumption assessment and energy potential analysis;- explain analysis techniques for urban climate processes;- analyse a selection of energy flows and urban climate issues as a basis for planning and design decisions;- distinguish different spatial design solutions for redirecting energy flows and urban climate adaptation;- propose planning and design interventions for energy flows and urban climate adaptation on different scales (metropolitan to neighborhood).",""]
