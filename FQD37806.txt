["FQD37806","Food Flavour Design","2MO","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- create formulations and design processing conditions to generate flavours during food thermal treatment via Maillard reaction and explain the flavour formation via fermentation;- evaluate strategies to delay the formation of off-flavours (lipid oxidation);- explain the chemistry of flavour compounds and their interaction with food matrices to formulate flavour solutions and to assess those in different matrices;- explain how the taste receptors work, where they are located and their effect in our body (brain and gut);- explain the effect of oral behaviour on flavour perception and the emotional reward which is created during eating;- explain the impact of flavour molecules on sensorial perception and the role of product architecture on flavour perception and how taste, texture, colour, flavour can influence each other (cross-modal interaction), and apply this knowledge to propose strategies to improve taste perception in re-formulated products;- explain analytical tools used for characterization of flavour compounds and relate these flavour compounds to sensory perception.",""]
