["FPE35403","Sustainable Food and Bioprocessing - Exergy analysis","6DL-1ST-HALF","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- perform exergy calculations;- analyse efficiency of process systems with exergy analysis;- prepare Grassmann diagrams for exergy flow and destruction in food and bioprocess systems;- identify thermodynamic (in)efficiencies, relate these to practical issues and options for improvement;- suggest improvements both in unit operations and in larger-scale production systems;- synthesize an overall vision on process efficiency and limitations and possibilities for improvement of sustainability in production processes.",""]
