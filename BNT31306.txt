["BNT31306","Metal Complex Coordination Chemistry & Characterization","5AF","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- recognize the importance of essential and non-essential metal ions in biological systems and material sciences;- reflect on the metal-ligand bond considering the d-block elements in various oxidation states;- deduce biologically-relevant metal ligand interactions via ligand replacement reactions;- understand the fluxional aspects of metal-coordinated ligands and their relevance for inorganic medicinal applications;- elaborate on the application of lanthanide ions in theragnostic coordination polymers;- predict the outcome of discrete polynuclear metal-organic complex synthesis and describe how the synthesis and final product can be analysed;- describe several approaches by which organometallic complexes can be made, how they can be conjugated to biological or bio-active molecules and how they interact with biomolecules like proteins and oligonucleotides;- apply laboratory class skills performing hands-on experiments (synthesis and characterization) and reflect on those via written report.",""]
