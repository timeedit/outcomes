["PCC20806","Soft Matter","5MO","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- define the concepts of soft matter as presented in the course text and lectures, and understand the quantitative expression of these concepts in terms of formulas (main concepts: colloidal interaction forces, colloidal stability, self-assembly, viscosity and visco-elasticity of colloidal systems);- recognize concepts of soft matter in concrete practical cases, and discuss their application, both qualitatively and quantitatively, to such cases;- handle the formulas in the course text in mathematically correct ways, and use them to calculate physical quantities, with due attention to units and dimensions;- solve theoretical problems dealing with the various applications of soft matter, with use of a formula compendium;- carry out experiments on soft matter phenomena in model systems following a given protocol, write a short laboratory report on such experiments, with a critical discussion of experimental findings, and a quantitative analysis using the concepts and formulas presented in the course text and lectures.",""]
