["SLM21306","Subsurface Solute Transport","5MO","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to: give examples of various (differential) equations and conceptual approaches for modelling solute transport; explain the processes involved in biochemically reactive solute transport and the concept of moment theory for interpreting transport behaviour; appraise the strengths and limitations of the convection-dispersion equation CDE, and judge the value of CDE and alternatives such as SCM and apply them for simple cases; install, connect and operate various soil sensors at an introductory level; critically evaluate the data the soil sensors generate to apply suitable (combinations of) instruments for observation/monitoring of solute transport in soils and groundwater; distinguish several numerical techniques to handle time and space scales of the CDE; derive numerical expressions for the CDE; perform model simulations of solute transport and groundwater flow.",""]
