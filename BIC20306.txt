["BIC20306","Cell Physiology and Genetics","4WD","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- explain the basic principles of inheritance of genetic information, and of mechanisms creating genetic diversity (gene and chromosome mutation, recombination processes);- explain how chromosomes and chromatin are organized and how genetic information is mapped;- infer the complex relation between genotype and phenotype;- describe the principles of expression of genetic information by transcription and translation and of the regulatory mechanisms occurring in these processes;- describe the folding, distribution, modification and degradation of proteins, and how their function relates to their structure;- infer the importance of these regulatory mechanisms for a variety of fundamental processes in living organisms, like creation of diversity, development, cell differentiation, metabolism, disease;- explain how to use experimental approaches such as yeast two-hybrid, Fluorescent in situ Hybridization, micro arrays, reporter genes, affinity purification, mass spectrometry, pedigree analysis, Chromatin immuno-precipitation.",""]
