["HWM30306","River Flow and Morphology","5AF","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:understand discharge and water level dynamics in rivers and streams in response to forcing functions;apply the St. Venant equations and their simplified versions to both scientific and practical problems;explain three-dimensional flow patterns in curved channel reaches;provide the theoretical background required to choose an appropriate sediment transport prediction formula in river science and engineering;predict the type of bedform and associated roughness to flow for a given flow and sediment transport condition;predict the primary bed evolution changes resulting from measures in a river system;understand and critically analyse scientific literature on river flow and morphology.",""]
