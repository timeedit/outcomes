["FPH30306","Advanced Food Physics","2AF","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- understand the relationship between colloidal structure of common food products and their stability and physical properties (viscosity, elasticity, fracture stress, yield stress);- understand how the microstructure of materials is affected by experimental parameters such as temperature, concentration, pH, ionic strength, and solvent quality;- select appropriate experimental methods to determine physical properties of foods (viscosity, Young's modulus , shear modulus, or fracture stress);- apply the understanding of structure-property relationships to analyse data obtained using these experimental methods.",""]
