["PCC22803","Theory of Relativity","1MO-1ST-HALF, 3MO","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- remember and use definitions and terms from the theory of relativity;- apply Galilean transformations to objects running at constant speed;- apply the transformation rules of Special Relativity to objects running at constant speed;- explain whether or not events can have a causal relationship and find a frame where two events take place either at the same time or at the same place;- interpret a Minkovski diagram to find relativistic data of an object running at constant speed;- use the Principle of Relativity to explain gravitational redshift, gravitational lensing and/or the phenomenon that clocks run slow in a gravitational field.",""]
