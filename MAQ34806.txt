["MAQ34806","Atmospheric Composition and Air Quality","2AF","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:(1) understand and apply basic numerical calculations in atmospheric physics and chemistry;(2) analyze the role of various physical and chemical processes in air pollution, climate change, and ozone destruction;(3) set up and apply simple models to simulate atmospheric change;(4) critically evaluate scientific papers on the effect of air pollution on human health.In more detail, after successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:explain the structure and composition of the atmosphere, and summarize the fundamental drivers of its composition;explain the global cycles of oxygen (O), carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) through the Earth reservoirs, and explain how these make life on Earth possible;summarize what controls climate on Earth. Students should be able to reflect on the different roles of climate parameters such as solar radiation, CO2, water vapour, aerosols and clouds;analyze the role of emissions and chemistry leading to ozone smog, and assess how ozone events may be countered in practice. They recognize the special role of aerosols in air pollution, climate change, and stratospheric ozone depletion;apply the concepts of emissions, residence time, lifetime, and distance of transport to set up a mass balance.",""]
