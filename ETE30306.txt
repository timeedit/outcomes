["ETE30306","Biological Processes for Resource Recovery","4WD","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- assess the thermodynamic feasibility of biological reactions for resources recovery under actual conditions;- assess the microbial biomass yield of biological reactions for resources recovery;- evaluate substrate properties (toxicity, bioavailability, biodegradability) for their effect on biological processes for resource recovery;- calculate the dimensions of bioreactors used for resource recovery;- explain biofilm theory and use the equations involved;- explain how biological processes can be used to produce recyclable crystals and minerals, and be able to use the involved mathematical relationships;- use the acquired knowledge to design a biological process to steer the microbial competition for substrates in mixed cultures in such a way that desired reactions occur.",""]
