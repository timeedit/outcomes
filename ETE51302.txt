["ETE51302","Data driven Environmental Modelling and Optimization for resource management","Academic_Year","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:classify different resource management problems and the associated mathematical models that are used in literature to study/solve them;recognize which models are used to represent urban systems and explain the differences in their applications;formulate resource management as a mathematical optimization problem;implement a given resource management problem in a high-level computational simulation environment;explain the results of a resource management simulation;draw conclusions in terms of real-world practice e.g., decide on the best system improvement strategies for stakeholders based on model outputs considering technical and economic requirements/characteristics.",""]
