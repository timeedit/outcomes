["CBI50806","Immunomodulation by Food and Feed","3WD","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- define and memorize the basic aspects of immune defence reactions against pathogens and the basis of the development of examples of immune-related diseases;- define and memorize the principles of gut-associated microbiota, their physiological functions and their major role in this defence;- understand the basic mechanisms of action whereby dietary components can modulate immune function with consequences for overall health of the individual;- apply the theoretical knowledge acquired during the course, to be able to deal with relevant research questions in the practical;- get a basis laboratory skills from the field of microbiology and in vitro cell culture with the quantitative measurement of response parameters (cell proliferation, cytokines synthesis, etc.)- apply the theoretical and practical knowledge acquired during the course to solve real-life case-related questions;- critically evaluate test systems for their results and implications of the finding for the detection of immunomodulatory activity of dietary components.",""]
