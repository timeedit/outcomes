["GEN30806","Population and Quantitative Genetics","6WD-1ST-HALF","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- define and describe important population and quantitative genetic concepts such as: genetic drift, natural selection, selective sweep, inbreeding, heritability and quantitative traits;- apply these population and quantitative genetic concepts to problems related to the genetic dynamics of natural, captive and artificially selected populations;- apply population and quantitative genetic concepts to problems related to the erosion of genetic diversity and methods for genetic conservation of populations;- infer consequences of population history for the current genetic characteristics of populations, and vice versa, to infer population history from current data.",""]
