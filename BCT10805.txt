["BCT10805","Process Engineering Basics","6MO","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- analyse processes that are relevant for agrotechnology and involve either heat exchange, mass- or energy production or transfer;- set up element balances, component balances and energy balances to mathematically describe what goes on in the given process;- apply stoichiometry and use an equilibrium approach in balances to evaluate the feasibility of individual process steps and to evaluate an entire process chain;- apply simplified mathematical models for heat transfer to describe and design heat-exchange processes;- apply simplified mathematical kinetic models in balances to describe and design conversion processes.",""]
