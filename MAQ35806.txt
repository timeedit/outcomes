["MAQ35806","Earth System Modelling","4WD","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- demonstrate comprehensive knowledge of the interactions between geophysical, dynamical and biogeochemical and atmospheric chemical processes at relevant spatial and temporal scales;- demonstrate insight in the availability and use of measurements to develop model components and evaluate the role of Earth system components;- demonstrate an understanding of basic concepts of modelling the Earth system and apply this across the full range of model complexity, from simple linear box models to fully-coupled 3-D Earth system models to study the Earth's environment and climate and global change;- identify a proper use of numerical approaches to study Earth system dynamics and characterize this application in terms of precision, stability, etc.;- apply concepts like model sensitivity, feedbacks, equilibria and non-linear behavior in studies based on the application of Earth system models; - work with computing systems and software, e.g., Linux computing environment, Matlab, climate data processing tools, plotting programs, etc., in Earth system studies;- define the appropriate modelling approach and tools to address specific research questions of, for example, MSc thesis studies on the Earth's environment and climate and global change.",""]
