["FCH32306","Food Digestion: Fermentation and Gut Health","3WD","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- understand how microbial metabolism takes place in the gut, including microbial processes, microbiota composition and â€“activity;- explain how the different layers of the colonic wall contribute to its normal physiological functioning;- understand dietary fibre complexity, structure & fermentation properties;- relate the food & food components to metabolic products;- understand how metabolites interact with barrier properties of the gut and how they affect gut health and human health in general;- evaluate in vivo and in vitro models to study the fermentation process and appropriate functioning of the colonic wall;- apply the knowledge on gut fermentation in a case study aiming to design a food product for a specific application e.g. healthy colon, for controlling food uptake, lowering cholesterol and glycaemic index, etc;- design, carry out and evaluate experiments using in vitro fermentation models and evaluate outcome.",""]
