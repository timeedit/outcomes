["MIB10306","Microbiology & Biochemistry","2AF, 3AF +  4AF","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- explain the importance of the large diversity of microorganisms for development and sustainment of life on earth;- explain that structure and function of enzymes are a link between chemistry and the living cell, and that biochemical unity underlies biological diversity;- explain the following basic principles of metabolism of (micro)organisms: manipulation of free energy by enzymes to direct metabolism, importance of oxidation-reduction reactions for extracting energy from organic and inorganic substrates, glycolysis, citric acid cycle and respiratory chain;- compare the basal metabolism with glucose as a model substrate in (micro)organisms in the presence and absence of external electron acceptors;- summarize a number of microbial interactions in specific ecosystems;- exemplify the influence of environmental factors on microbial activity in the cycling of nutrients, like carbon, nitrogen, sulfur and iron;- practice a set of basic microbial experiments with emphasis on aseptic techniques for transfer and handling of microorganisms;- enrich and isolate microorganisms under defined environmental conditions.",""]
