["PCC40806","Computer Modelling of Biomolecules","6MO","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- judge relevant basic concepts in computer modelling of biomolecules: molecular forces, energy minimization, statistical thermodynamics, Schr√∂dinger equation;- analyse the formulas presented in the course text, lectures, and tutorials in a mathematically correct way, and apply them in simple computations (with due attention to dimensions and units);- explain the essentials of computer modelling of biomolecules: molecular mechanics, molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo, Langevin Dynamics, Brownian Dynamics, Quantum Computations;- properly interpret the results of computer simulations on relevant biomolecular systems.",""]
