["TOX31306","Environmental Risk Assessment of Chemicals","6WD-1ST-HALF","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:_x000d_- create a vision on the concepts of prospective and retrospective environmental risk assessment;_x000d_- reflect upon communalities and differences between environmental risk assessment and risk assessment for human health and food;_x000d_- recognize the evolution of regulatory frameworks by studying past, present and future frameworks that are  presently under construction;_x000d_- integrate science and process based knowledge with the abovementioned concepts in the design, conduction and interpretation of environmental risk  assessment of chemicals in different frameworks at play in the EU (e.g.  Plant Protection Products and biocide registration, REACH, Site Specific environmental risk assessment, Water Framework Directive, setting of environmental quality standards) ;_x000d_- compile and evaluate inputs for environmental risk assessment in different settings and frameworks, and reflect upon the potential impact of uncertainty;_x000d_- analyse concepts of read across between chemicals and interpolation between species and cases;_x000d_- critically conduct the technical and computational steps in environmental risk  assessment in different settings and frameworks, integrated with the relevant stakeholders;_x000d_- interpret results of environmental risk  assessment and provide input for risk management, risk communication and risk governance.",""]
