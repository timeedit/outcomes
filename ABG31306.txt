["ABG31306","Genetic Improvement of Livestock","2MO","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:Â - derive multiple trait selection indices and the corresponding accuracy of selection for simple situations;- derive breeding goals based on information on economic and societal properties of the production system;- understand and set-up mixed model equations to estimate breeding values in small data sets;- explain the underlying principles of genomic selection and its consequences for the structure of breeding programs;- predict the rate of genetic improvement of alternative breeding programs;- understand and discuss the consequences of different structures of breeding programs on the response to selection and the rate of inbreeding;- explain and quantify the effect of selection on the genetic variance (Bulmer effect).",""]
