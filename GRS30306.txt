["GRS30306","Spatial Modelling and Statistics","5MO","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- explain commonly used dynamic spatial modelling methods and techniques;- construct a simple dynamic spatial model using Netlogo for a given spatial problem and data set;- investigate the spatial correlation structure of a data set using semivariogram analysis;- apply geo-statistical interpolation and spatial stochastic simulation methods;- construct a stochastic error model to represent uncertainty in spatial data;Â - apply fist order Taylor series and Monte Carlo methods for analysing propagation of input uncertainty through spatial models.",""]
