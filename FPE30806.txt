["FPE30806","Sustainable Food and Bioprocessing","4WD","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:_x000d_- prepare Sankey diagrams for heat and mass, in food and bioprocess systems;_x000d_- apply pinch analysis to relatively complex (continuous) production systems, identify options for improvement and synthesize the optimal exchanger network;_x000d_- prepare Grassmann diagrams for exergy flow and destruction in food and bioprocess systems;_x000d_- analyse process systems with exergy analysis, identify thermodynamic efficiencies locally or globally, and relate this to practical issues and options for improvement;_x000d_- suggest improvements both in unit operations and in larger-scale production systems;_x000d_- synthesize an overall vision on process efficiency and limitation and possibilities for improvement of sustainability in production processes.",""]
