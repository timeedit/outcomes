["HPP31806","Advanced Methods for Plant-Climate Research in Controlled Environments","4WD","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to: - use common and advanced methods for measuring microclimates and related plant variables (e.g. Air and Plant/organ temperature, Light, Air Humidity, Windspeed); - understand the advantages and disadvantages of specific equipment;- describe the relevant differences between traditional and new artificial light sources used for plant growth (Fluorescent tubes, High-pressure sodium lamps versus different types of LEDs);- measure, analyse and explain light environments (mixed and pure daylight/artificial light environments) with respect to intensity, spectrum and duration;- correctly use terminology and units related to radiometry and photometry and make conversions between them;- explain the functional differences between different type of 'light' meters (e.g. PAR-sensor, spectroradiometer), their limitations and advantages and their suitability for different applications;- calculate and explain the backgrounds and meaning of derived parameters such as R/FR ratios, phytochrome stationary states (PSS) and specific wavelength fractions (e.g. blue light) for physiological plant responses;- name the essential components, functional relationship and use of gas-exchange systems for photosynthesis, transpiration and leaf (stomatal conductance) measurements;- make essential calculations from raw measured data into established units for photosynthesis and transpiration, including corrections related to system leaks and transpiration; - understand and be able to explain the theoretical background of chlorophyll-fluorescence (CF) measurements;- derive parameters from the raw CF-measurements and explain how leaf photosynthesis can be estimated from these parameters, including assumptions and limitations;- understand, execute and explain several common and new measuring protocols to derive physiological meaningful information from GE and CF-measurements on plants (e.g. Light Response Curves, A-Ci-curves, dark respiration (RD) in dark and light, spatial resolved variation in stomatal conductance);- understand and explain the relationship between these advanced protocols and models for photosynthesis (such as for instance the Farquhar-von Caemmerer-Berry (FvCB) biochemical model of photosynthesis);- explain the potential and importance of physical-physiological measurements for plant phenotyping and new phenotyping systems.",""]
