["ABG51806","Wildlife Conservation Genetics","5AF","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- explain the importance of genetic diversity for the conservation of species;- understand the importance of genetic tools and concepts to construct breeding plans and programmes for conservation;- apply these tools in various practicals and in the Studbook assignment;- identify the major evolutionary forces that shape genetic variation in wild populations;- explain the concept of effective population size;- calculate inbreeding coefficients in small populations;- explain the dynamics of genetic variation due to population size and structure;- evaluate and construct management and conservation breeding plans and programmes.",""]
