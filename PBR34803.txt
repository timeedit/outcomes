["PBR34803","Experimental Design and Data Analysis of Breeding Trials","4DL","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to: - comprehend statistical principles underlying experimental designs for breeding trials with respect to randomization, replication (including types of replicates and pseudo-replication), blocking, experimental units, the use of controls, orthogonality, balance and efficiency, power; - comprehend the connections between these design principles and the models and model assumptions underlying statistical analyses, most importantly linear regression and analysis of variance (distributional assumptions, independence, equal variance; additivity or linearity of effects, single or multiple random error terms); - apply these concepts when designing an experiment; - explain, distinguish and characterize the following experimental designs: completely randomized design (CRD), randomized complete block design (RCB), incomplete block designs (including resolvable designs: lattice designs and alpha designs, row-column designs) and split-plot designs; - understand effects of missing values, data errors, outliers, uneven replication, confounding of effects, and violations of distributional assumptions and assumptions of equal variance and independence; - understand when generalized linear models (GLM) are more appropriate for data analysis than linear regression or Anova; - understand when linear mixed models (LMM) are more appropriate for data analysis than linear regression or Anova; - be able to perform different analyses using GLMs: logistic regression for binary data, threshold models for multinomial or ordinal data, loglinear regression for counts; - understand how and why distribution and link functions need to be specified in GLMs; - understand the difference between fixed terms and random terms in a mixed model analysis, both conceptually and in applications; - specify a linear mixed model in fixed and random terms for a data analysis with unbalanced designs; - specify a linear mixed model in fixed and random terms for a data analysis with dependent observations; - comprehend and apply linear mixed models in different contexts: estimation of variance components (e.g. for heritability estimation), or quantify the relative importance of environmental and genetic contributions to the variation in multi-environment trials; analysis of split-plot trials; - use a linear mixed model for the estimation of variance components; - explain genotype by environment interaction as a concept in multi-environment trials in plant breeding and in statistical terms; - quantify, test and characterize genotype-by-environment interaction using different evaluation methods: analysis of variance, mixed models, Finlay-Wilkinson regression, AMMI and GGE biplot; - comprehend and discuss the concepts of stability, adaptability and (wide/specific) adaptation in plant breeding in the context of Finlay-Wilkinson regression; - estimate heritability of traits from estimates of variance components obtained from Anova and mixed models in genotype trials.",""]
