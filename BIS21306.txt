["BIS21306","Webs of Terrestrial Diversity","6WD-2ND-HALF","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to: - recognize groups of organisms that contribute to biodiversity in terrestrial ecosystems: vascular plants, arthropods, and nematodes/micro-organisms;&nbsp;- identify those groups by applying traditional as well present-day identification techniques, including DNA-based approaches;&nbsp;- carry out a research project: formulate and present research questions and a project proposal, carry out experimental work in the field, collect and record data, analyse results, and present the results in a mini-symposium;-&nbsp;interpret&nbsp;the influence of the most important abiotic factors, geology and soil types on vegetation;- apply biodiversity indices for these groups of organisms;&nbsp;- explain the biology and ecology of these groups of organisms;- employ the phylogenetic relationships of vascular plants and arthropods;-&nbsp;discuss the trophic interactions between above-and belowground food webs.",""]
