["BIP11805","Introduction Quantum Mechanics","6OTHER","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:  - understand why classical mechanics is replaced by quantum mechanics to describe the behavior of microscopic systems; - apply the Schr√∂dinger equation to describe the dynamics of quantum systems; - apply the concepts of wavefunctions, the Born interpretation, observables, superposition of states, expectation values and the Heisenberg uncertainty relation; - use these principles to describe translation motion, tunnelling, vibrational motion and rotational motion of quantum mechanical systems.",""]
