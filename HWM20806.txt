["HWM20806","Hydrogeology","1MO","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to: interpret hydraulic properties of both unconsolidated and hard rocks, types of saturated flow, hydrochemical conditions and stream-aquifer interaction; apply knowledge on hydraulic properties of different rocks, types of saturated flow, hydrochemical conditions and stream-aquifer interaction; evaluate hydrogeological systems in different environments, incl. regions with extreme climates (permafrost and (semi-)arid regions); compile a conceptual model of a hydrogeological system in the field; develop a simple groundwater flow model for a representative hydrogeological system; present models in a plenary setting both in the field (field classes Belgian Ardennes) and in a lecture room (modelling part).",""]
