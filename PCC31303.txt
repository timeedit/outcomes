["PCC31303","Research Methods Soft Matter","3AF","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to1. Explain and apply the basic principles of:- optical microscopy, including confocal microscopy;- image filtering & quantitative image analysis;- static and dynamic light scattering;- indentation and adhesion tests;- optical trapping and manipulation2. Independently perform and judge:- dynamic light scattering measurements and analyze correlation functions manually and using CONTIN analysis;- static light-scattering experiments and extract quantitative data through fitting with theoretical models, to extract particles sizes, molecular weights, and sample microstructure;- indentation instrumentation and experiments with analysis to extract material stiffness and adhesion energy;- quantitative confocal microscopy experiments, and judge image quality in terms of dynamic range, contrast and noise levels, and to enhance image quality and extract quantitative data using image filtering methods3. Design and develop the inner workings of instrumentation. ",""]
