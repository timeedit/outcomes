["XWT24305","Physical Chemistry in Water Technology","1WD +  2WD","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- identify the relevant physio-chemical parameters in Water Technology processes;- apply the concepts of physical chemistry to a number of Water Technology-related processes, e.g., mixing entropy to Blue energy, electrochemical potential to (reverse) electro-dialysis;  - calculate the effect of changing one or more experimental or environmental parameters on a particular Water Technology process, e.g. the effect of temperature or salt concentration on the process of Blue energy.",""]
