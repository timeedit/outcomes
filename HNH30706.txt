["HNH30706","Food Digestion: Nutrient Breakdown and Absorption","4WD","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- describe and explain the structure and functioning of the small intestine, and have insight how and why these may differ between relevant species (human, mouse, pig, cattle, poultry);- evaluate the impact of food-related factors on bioavailability of nutrients and bioactive compounds;- understand the etiology of some of the most common intestinal diseases and how these affect nutrient absorption and metabolic health;- understand the main sensing and regulatory mechanisms that influence food digestion and absorption at the molecular level, with a focus on macronutrients, and provide clues how these can be exploited to prevent (systemic) disease;- compare in vitro and in silico models of food digestion with digestion in vivo;- demonstrate laboratory skills;- demonstrate basic mathematical modelling skills.",""]
