["MAQ35306","Urban Hydrometeorology","4WD","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:analyse the physical mechanisms behind the urban heat island, and evaluate the urban air quality, human thermal comfort (biometeorology), and analyse their dependence on heatwaves;analyse the role of key aspects of the urban water cycle, and assess its consequences for its response to precipitation extremes and droughts;evaluate the impact of design elements on the urban environment;apply novel measurement techniques, including crowdsourcing to sense the urban hydroclimate; and analyse and evaluate their outcome as well as their strengths and weaknesses;apply state of the art modelling strategies for the urban hydrometeorology, and analyse and evaluate their results and their strengths and weaknesses;deduce the open issues in fundamental and applied research in urban hydrometeorology, from the literature and own research.",""]
