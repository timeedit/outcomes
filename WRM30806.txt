["WRM30806","Water Delivery","5MO","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- apply the advanced surface hydraulics in the calibration, evaluation and optimisation of on-farm surface irrigation;- set-up and conduct a field experiment and conduct its data set-up, processing and error assessment, valuing different measurement / data processing methods;- to design an on-farm pressurised irrigation system and determine its investment and operational costs;- consider the various socio-economic impacts associated with the transformation from surface to pressurised irrigation systems;Â - calculate a long-term salt balance under various agro-climatic conditions, and the requisite leaching requirements to avoid salinisation of the soil;- identify the measures that need to be taken in irrigated agriculture to avoid salinisation, sodification and water logging;- apply performance indicators of water efficiency, productivity and economic value at different scales, and how these can be applied for a quantitative analysis of the environmental and socio-economic impacts of irrigated agriculture.",""]
