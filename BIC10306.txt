["BIC10306","Practical Biological Chemistry","4WD, 5AF","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- describe general genome structure and gene organization, transcription and RNA processing in eukaryotes- understand the principles and explain the use of basic molecular techniques to study genes, such as restriction digestion, agarose gel electrophoresis, cloning, Southern blotting and Western blotting, (RT)-PCR and sequencing- apply basic techniques in molecular biology, such as DNA, RNA and protein isolation, (RT)-PCR, restriction enzyme digestions, agarose gel electrophoresis, cloning and Western blotting- understand and apply the principles of absorption- and fluorescence spectroscopy, immunology, electrophoresis, polarography and proteomics - perform enzymatic assays, interpret  data on enzyme catalysis, and relate the results to clinical and nutrition related  questions - use DNA- and protein analysis software (BLAST, 3D-protein structure viewer, proteomics databases) - calculate and interpret independently the results of their experiments- write a report about an enzymatic reaction mechanism studied during the laboratorium experiments",""]
