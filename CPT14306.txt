["CPT14306","Life Sciences for Communication Scientists","5MO","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- describe examples of life- science based approaches to complex societal problems in six specific life science domains (health, food, urbanisation, climate change, natural resource management, and sustainability related to food and fibre production);- use science communication models and approaches to explain relevant issues for strategic communication within the life science domains, including tensions and opportunities in the communication between life scientists and societal stakeholders;- apply science communication models and approaches to formulate and critically assess goals and means to effectively communicate these issues;- apply science communication principles to produce a communication item, e.g. a feature article, about societal issues in a life science domain;- reflect on the case for collaboration between life-sciences and communication theory, research and practice in addressing complex societal challenges, and the added value of interdisciplinary collaboration;- justify the choice of one of the six life science domains as the focus area ('track') in their minor program.",""]
