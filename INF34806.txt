["INF34806","Agent-Based Modelling of Complex Adaptive Systems","4WD","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to carry out the cycle of simulation-based research about emergence in a natural and/or social system of their own definition. Specifically they are expected to be able to:- apply the concepts from the course book. This is specified in the following practical learning outcomes, all of which will be assessed through the students' case study;- formulate research questions. This includes selecting a theoretical or empirical question to investigate; fixing an appropriate level of analysis for agents and system; choosing an appropriate level of abstraction (abstract, stylized, or facsimile); operationalizing theoretical constructs in agent properties (perception, motion, communication, action, memory, policy) and in environment properties (heterogeneity, change); modelling agent learning (by experience, evolution, or teaching) and system learning (by emergence);- create simulations. This involves developing code in NetLogo (https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) that operationalizes the research questions;- carry out validation. This involves systematic sensitivity analysis of the variable space and validation against theory, expert knowledge and / or empirical data, using the tools in NetLogo Behaviour-Space;- draw conclusions. This involves reporting on all of the above steps for one's own project, both in a presentation that uses the simulation created, and in a report.",""]
