["ABG30806","Modern Statistics for the Life Sciences","5AF","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to: - explain the general differences between a linear model (LM), linear mixed model (LMM) and generalized linear model (GLM) in terms of model assumptions; - present simple examples of data structures that should either be analysed by a LM, LMM or GLM; - execute an analysis with a standard LM (ANOVA or regression), LMM (split-plot) or GLM (logistic regression or log linear model) for a given data set and interpret the results of such an analysis; - explain the principle of maximum likelihood estimation; - describe the differences between Bayesian and frequentistic statistics; - explain how the heritability of a trait can be estimated in pedigreed populations and in a cross between inbred lines; - explain how Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) can be detected in an outcross population and in a cross between inbred lines and design QTL mapping experiments; - design an experiment for estimating heritabilities, for QTL mapping and for genome-wide association studies (GWAS);- explain the difference between a linkage study and an association study;- explain how genomic prediction can be done and be able to critically discus statistical models for that purpose.",""]
