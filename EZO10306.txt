["EZO10306","Zoology","5AF","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:_x000d_- outline the basic key events in vertebrate development (Xenopus) and  the extra-embryonic membranes and apply the knowledge of genetic principles to the development of a vertebrate;_x000d_- identify and determine the relationship of vertebrate anatomical structures to each other and to the organism as a whole;_x000d_- outline fundamental knowledge of the mammalian nervous- and endocrine system and explain regulation mechanisms of the systems using examples especially on reproduction in mammals._x000d_- demonstrate and explain how structure and function interact, applied to the sensory, nervous and muscular system;_x000d_- correlate and integrate structure with function in the vertebrate integument (skin) and the skeletal system;_x000d_- identify and describe the structure and function of basic tissue-types from their microscopic appearance and relate them with their macroscopic morphology;_x000d_- apply scientific techniques to study gross anatomy (dissection techniques), microanatomy (microscopy) and physiology (laboratory techniques and experimental set-ups for in vivo measurements).",""]
