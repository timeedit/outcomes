["BNT30803","Research Methods BioNanoTechnology 3D, Device Design & Development","4AF","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to apply and implement miniaturization techniques for chemical and analytical instrumentation. Students are expected to be able to:1.explain the principles of top-down and bottom-up fabrication techniques focused chemical and analytical instrumentation;2.distinguish and outline a procedure for novel miniaturization of analytical techniques;3.apply and implement building blocks of miniaturization techniques, such as;   a. DIY fabrication techniques, such as ESCARGOT and other open technologies;   b. interfacing electronics such as ARDUINO;   c. 3D Design and 3D printing of small-scale devices;(The specific subtopics to be treated under learning outcome 3 are subject to change each year and are a selection of the mentioned topics.) 4.interpret and apply the principles of electronic circuits of a radiofrequency coil for NMR and MRI applications;5.understand and demonstrate the home-built devices for NMR and MRI applications.",""]
