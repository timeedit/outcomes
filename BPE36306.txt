["BPE36306","Advanced Bioreactor Design","3WD","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to: - remember the effects of cell retention, biofilms and scale- up on physical reactor behavior; - understand the strategy for building mathematical models for bioreactors, and for simplifying and solving them; - apply such models to design reactors and optimize their operation in the framework of a process;- analyze how design choices and operating conditions affect the outcome of a process; - create better processes given an optimization criterion.",""]
