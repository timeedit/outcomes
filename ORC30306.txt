["ORC30306","Applied Biocatalysis","1AF","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- evaluate and understand the effects of immobilisation, environmental effects and changes in kinetic parameters on the kinetics and selectivity of enzymes;- analyse transport phenomena inside immobilised biocatalysts;- calculate effectiveness factors and mass transfer coefficients;- analyse literature reports on the biocatalytic synthesis of fine chemicals, and make decisions on the pros and cons of these routes;- evaluate the factors that determine cost effectiveness in industrial biocatalytic processes;- understand the structure and working mechanisms of monoclonal antibodies and antibody-drug conjugates;- analyse literature on the use of enzymes for the post-recombinant modification of biopharmaceuticals;- analyse literature on the use of enzymes for the biotechnological production of biobased products from lignocellulosic by-products.",""]
