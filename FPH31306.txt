["FPH31306","Advanced Molecular Gastronomy","3WD","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- identify the physical phenomena and understand the mechanisms of action that play a role in products as ice-cream, chocolate and bakery products;- understand the mechanisms behind important taste modalities (bitter, sweet, umami, astringent);- use practical experiments to associate physical phenomena to effects on texture and chemical processes to flavour;- use results of analytical methods to investigate products, such as ice cream and wine with different composition;- analyse the composition of wines and ice cream recipes and relate this to their structural properties and flavour characteristics observed.",""]
