["GEN21306","Personal Genetics","1AF","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- explain the basic genetic processes in eukaryotes: transmission of genetic information, the relationship between genotype and phenotype, the regulation and expression of genes, the generation of variation, the organization of genomes and genes;- summarize the basic genetic methods: how genomes are explored, how populations are studied, how quantitative characters are studied, how genetics is applied in life sciences;- recall tools and methods to study gene expression;- recall and explain general genetic terms as described in the appropriate chapters of the textbook (i.e. to be able to understand and to speak the genetic language at a basic level);- design, explain and interpret genetic experiments and observations, e.g. to recognize and analyse patterns of inheritance, gene interactions, consequences of chromosomal changes, genetic changes in populations, quantitative characters and epigenetic inheritance;- analyse and judge the use of genetics in societal questions;- interpret ethical aspects of genome wide sequence information.",""]
