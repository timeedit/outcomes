["MAT51806","Data-driven Modelling of Dynamic Systems","6MO","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- identify a simple dynamic process model based on data or input/output signals;- model systems on the basis of prior system’s knowledge and experimental input/output data, and estimate the unknown model parameters;- simulate and analyze “simple” models from, for example, systems biology and to estimate/calibrate the unknown parameters in the model;- apply the 'System Identification Toolbox' as provided in the MATLAB system identification toolbox (software).",""]
