["MAQ31806","Atmospheric Modelling","5MO","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:use atmospheric models currently used in research, meteorological and air quality institutes and consultancies;address how modelling can assist in understanding societal relevant environmental problems as e.g. extreme weather, wind, energy or air quality;design numerical experiments related to specific research questions;explain and discuss the principles and theory of atmospheric models from local to regional scales;integrate the knowledge of atmospheric processes obtained in previous courses and other disciplines like atmospheric dynamics, boundary layer processes, atmospheric chemistry, hydrology or land-atmosphere interaction;assess the potential applications of these models and their limitations;apply these models in real working situations to understand and interpret meteorological and air quality phenomena; evaluate model performance by comparison of model results with observations or other models;present model results and their analysis, related to concrete research questions.",""]
