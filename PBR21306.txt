["PBR21306","Biosystematics, Evolution and Agrobiodiversity","4WD","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:_x000d_- understand quantitative and population genetics concepts,  including heritability, random mating, natural selection, fitness,  and genetic drift;_x000d_- understand evolutionary concepts explaining the origin of biological complexity, including mutation, horizontal gene transfer, and genome duplications;_x000d_- explain species concepts and apply biosystematic approaches for the reconstruction of phylogenetic trees;_x000d_- apply these evolutionary and population genetic concepts to understand crop evolution, pathogen evolution and host-pathogen co-evolution; _x000d_- apply evolutionary concepts in contemporary issues in plant sciences, including conservation of genetic resources, breeding, ecological aspects of GMO release, invasive plants and pathogen species.",""]
