["XWT34305","Multi-component Mass Transfer in Membrane Processes","4WD +  5WD","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- demonstrate fundamental insight in multicomponent mass transport theory;- explain and describe mass transport within the theoretical framework of Maxwell-Stefan;- apply modelling with Maxwell-Stefan to molecular separation problems based on adsorption, absorption and membrane separations;- translate theory to practical problems, oriented at membrane separations;- perform basic computer simulations of multicomponent mass transport problems;- acquire in-depth knowledge by carrying out case studies in Matlab;- acquire new knowledge by preparing one of the lectures;- develop and present materials in lectures.",""]
