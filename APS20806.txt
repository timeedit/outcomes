["APS20806","Systems Approach in Animal Sciences","4WD","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to: - define the system that corresponds to a specific research question. This implies that, given the research question, students are expected to be able to define the system boundary, the components of the system and their mutual relations, and the context of the system; - apply the systems approach and the different methods/techniques used in different steps, as applied by the Animal Production Systems group to explore sustainable development options of animal production systems; - analyse farm characteristics statistically; - simulate the behavior of a system in time using NetLogo software; - apply linear programming and scenario analysis as tools to study sustainable development options in animal production systems; - use measurement instruments to detect human preferences and perceptions regarding animal production systems; - assess the contribution of various animal production systems to sustainable development based on quantification of sustainability indicators.",""]
