["BPE34806","Pharmaceutical Biotechnology","3WD","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- recall the steps in a pharmaceutical process development value chain;- explain how the steps in a pharmaceutical process development value chain relate to process scale, GMP requirements and associated development costs;- perform the following steps of a biopharmaceutical production process:  cell culture, sterile handling of cells, bioreactor operation, product purification and analysis of cell viability, product-, nutrient-, metabolite- and cell concentration and product quality;- apply the outcomes of these analyses to assess the state of the process and to design a strategy to adjust process parameters such as stirring, aeration or feeding when necessary;- recall the specific physiological properties of animal cells that are relevant for biopharmaceutical process development;- evaluate the relevance of different bioreactors and culture strategies for animal cell culture;- design a bioreactor for animal cell cultivation based on biological and physical constraints;- design a virus production process;- optimize process settings based on knowledge on the relationship between process parameters and product formation and quality;- explain how available process analytical tools for bioprocess monitoring can be used for process monitoring and control and discuss their value during process development and routine manufacturing of biopharmaceutical products;- recall, explain and apply the principles of Quality by Design and other process quality systems in biopharmaceutical development, including calculations of key performance indicators;- recall the different purification steps and their working principle for a pharmaceutical protein;- discuss the integration of the purification process in the total pharmaceutical production process",""]
