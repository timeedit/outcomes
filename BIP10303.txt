["BIP10303","Physics MLS","2AF-2ND-HALF","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- demonstrate understanding of Newton's laws that describe the motion of simple objects in time and space by lusing differential and integral calculus to solve problems encountered in real life practice;- explain and apply the work-energy theorem which describes how net work on a system changes the kinetic and or potential energy of the system ;- explain and apply various conservation laws (energy, impulse and angular impulse) that describe mechanical systems;- explain and apply the concepts of electromagnetism, optics, oscillations and waves and their implications of superposition on interference phenomena;- analyse real life problems using mathematical and physical formalisms introduced in this course during the lecture and the exercises;- demonstrate understanding of using numerical computation environments to solve small problem sets.",""]
