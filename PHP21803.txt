["PHP21803","Plant Pathology and Disease Epidemiology","3DL","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to: - summarize molecular and physiological principles of interactions between plants and attackers; - discuss the complexity of defence mechanisms that plants possess to (directly or indirectly) counteract attackers; - compare different strategies and biochemical tools used by attackers to invade plants and reproduce; - explain how symbiotic organisms interact with plants without triggering defence responses; - understand that the trophic lifestyle of an attacker is related to the way in which it uses its genetic toolbox; - describe case studies of plant disease epidemics in time and space (field, regional, and continental scale); - apply key concepts in the population biology of plant diseases, such as exponential growth, logistic growth, life tables, relative rate of increase, and net reproductive ratio; - describe the effect of host genetics, crop diversity and landscape diversity on the rate of spread and population increase of plant diseases and pests; - understand and apply basic probability models for sampling distributions of plant disease; - formulate concepts for integrated management of plant disease on the basis of insight in epidemiology.",""]
