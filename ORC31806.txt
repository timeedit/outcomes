["ORC31806","Bio-organic Chemistry at Surfaces: Tuning the Outermost Nanometer","4WD","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- define and recognize key concepts from the course related to (bio-)organic surface chemistry;- describe reaction mechanisms covered in the course (on polymer synthesis, click reactions, surface modification reactions, membrane chemistry, and the synthesis of nanoparticles and nanoporous materials), and to recognize and apply these reactions in the design of new structures and surfaces;- propose preparation methods of various surface-related structures (see above) and describe how the structure properties lead to specific (bio-) applications;- explain the working principle of presented characterization methods; analyze and evaluate results of these methods, and design characterization experiments;- understand how organic reactions occur at a surface or interface and how these reactions operate differently at a surface compared to in bulk solution;- perform experiments (safely, efficiently) and related to polymer synthesis and surface chemistry, as well as investigate the formed structures using various experimental techniques;- prepare a practical report in which experimental results and appropriate theory are combined.",""]
