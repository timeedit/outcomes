["HNH32903","Intermediate Analytical Epidemiology: Confounding and Effect Measure Modification","1DL-2ND-HALF","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- identify confounding and effect measure modification by stratification;- adjust the association for confounding by calculating a pooled estimate;- identify confounding and effect measure modification by linear regression modelling;- apply linear regression modelling to adjust an association for confounding and to increase precision;- understand and appreciate the difference between the epidemiological and statistical approach;- identify potential confounding variables and effect measure modifying variables based on literature and include this in a data analysis plan;- understand and apply logistic regression, and interpret the results;- understand the principles of energy adjustment;- understand the relevance of energy adjustment because of  correction for diet composition, removal of external variation in intake, or confounding;- understand methods to adjust for energy, including the multivariate, density, and residual approach;- apply the approaches for energy adjustment in R;- interpret the coefficients of each of the three energy adjustment approaches.",""]
