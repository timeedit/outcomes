["HMI30306","Commensal and Pathogen Host-Microbe Interactions in the Intestine","5AF","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- describe and explain the differences in animal model systems employed in host-microbe interaction research;- select the appropriate model systems to investigate specific questions on molecular interactions between the host and the intestinal microbiota;- comprehend and apply data-mining approaches to decipher the mechanisms of host-microbe and host-pathogen interactions;- describe, explain and select the appropriate technological approaches to investigate host microbe interactions in research models;- interpret and judge the reliability of results obtained in experiments in the field of host-microbe interactions;- evaluate and criticize the scientific evidence underlying the mechanisms of molecular cross-talk between intestinal microbes, mucosal pathogens/pathobionts and the host;- independently read and evaluate scientific papers in this field;- design concise research proposals to address specific questions in this scientific area.
