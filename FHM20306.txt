["FHM20306","Food Microbiology","1AF","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- describe main preservation processes and the spoilage associated organisms for specific food products;- explain the factors that influence growth and inactivation of micro-organisms in food products qualitatively and quantitatively;- understand main characteristics of microorganisms that cause foodborne diseases (including mycotoxin producing fungi), and their relation to food products, and apply this to foodborne incidents;- illustrate the variety of routes by which micro-organisms may reach food products, and the main control measures to prevent unacceptable contamination;- explain the importance and the basic principles of hygiene including hand hygiene, formation of biofilm, zoning, cleaning and disinfection in food production environments;- explain the basic principles of fermentation (role of specific micro-organisms, metabolic routes, control of fermentation processes), and relate these to some western and non-western fermented products;- use isolation procedures to isolate and enumerate important spoilage organisms and foodborne pathogens from food products and environments.",""]
