["MAQ22806","Atmosphere-Vegetation-Soil Interactions","5AF","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to: calculate radiative fluxes at the surface and in a canopy for given surface conditions and atmospheric conditions, as well as analyse observed fluxes of the four components of net radiation; explain and apply methods to determine soil hydraulic and thermal properties; analyse and calculate the behaviour and movement of heat, water and solutes in the soil-water-vegetation-atmosphere system; analyse the role of turbulence, shear and stratification in atmospheric exchange processes in the lower 100 meters above the ground, and describe and apply similarity relationships; solve practical problems related to atmospheric transport processes (e.g. calculation of evaporation and transpiration, soil temperatures, CO2-transport, deposition, surface temperature and the radiation balance); analyse the interaction between soil transport processes, crop growth and atmospheric surface fluxes, both by combining the process-descriptions for the various compartments and by using ecohydrological models; explain how the exchange processes are modelled in large- and small-scale numerical models and for practical applications; use an agrohydrological model to analyse the interaction between soil transport processes and crop growth.",""]
