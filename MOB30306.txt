["MOB30306","Control of Cellular Processes and Cell Differentiation","1AF","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- describe strategies of cells to regulate cellular processes;- explain the basic principles of the biochemistry of signal-transducing pathways and the human sensory systems and in hormonal and enzymatic regulation at a molecular level in relation to diseases such as cancer;- describe how chromatin and RNAi control gene expression;- explain the basic principles of the cell cycle, apoptosis and DNA repair and infer the relation between these processes with development and cancer;- translate a simple cell biological process in a mathematical model;- explain how advanced microscopic techniques  are used to study the behaviour and interactions of proteins in living cells;- collect, arrange and critically analyse literature data dealing with regulation of cellular processes.",""]
