["FPH21806","Unifying Concepts for Life Sciences","5AF","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:1. Describe unifying concepts relevant to the areas of environmental, social, economic, agri-food, animal and plant sciences (such as power-law behavior, networks, self-similarity, fractals, nonlinear interaction, feedback, adaptation, energy minimization, scaling);2. Recall unifying concepts, and identify which ones are relevant to specific problems in the areas under 1;3. Use basic methods (such as scaling, network analysis, fractal dimension calculation) to analyze (aspects of) systems relevant to the areas mentioned under 1;4. Apply the unifying concepts and according methodologies to analyze phenomena and combinations thereof in the areas mentioned under 1. The phenomena include sustainable production and innovations.",""]
