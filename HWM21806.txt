["HWM21806","Hydraulics and Hydrometry","5AF","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- apply the laws of conservation of mass, energy and momentum to hydraulic problems;- calculate hydrostatic and -dynamic pressures and resultant forces on structures;- calculate water level and flow velocity in uniform open channel flow, when cross sectional area, slope of the channel and roughness are known or can be measured;- calculate surface level profiles for gradually varying non-uniform flow (back water curve, draw down curve), with the aim to know the consequences of measures in currents and streams; - measure the discharge in small open channels by using discharge measurement techniques including the velocity area method, the slope area method, the dilution method;- apply discharge formulas for discharge measurement structures; - calculate energy losses in closed pipe systems by applying friction coefficients and loss coefficients from literature.",""]
