["HPP23806","Crops, Physiology and Environment","2AF","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- understand relationships between plant growth and their abiotic environment and crop physiological aspects relevant for crop production;- identify key components of and conceptualise complex systems;- explain and develop concepts that are key to an understanding of various areas of environmental plant physiology based on knowledge on elementary chemistry and physics;- build concept maps (graphical representation of interlinked knowledge of different domains) of interactions between the physical environment and plant functioning;Â - understand the meaning and importance of parameters and concepts in plant and crop growth: e.g. RGR, NAR, LAR, light interception, light use efficiency, biomass partitioning [sink strength, functional equilibrium], water use efficiency;- argue and make calculations for (key processes in) crop growth and yield, based on the above mentioned parameters and concepts;- understand what reasonable values are for important parameters and for simulated outcomes of plant growth models.",""]
