["BIF31806","Data Driven Discovery in the Life Sciences: Hypothesis Generation from Omics Data","6MO","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- describe the advantages and limitations of different types of omics data;- access, in a high throughput manner, databases commonly used in the life sciences for the interpretation of omics data;- design effective omics experiments, with appropriate replicates, controls, controlling for batch effects, etc.;- evaluate the quality and limitations of omics data (quality of the raw data, technical/biological variation, etc.) based on the outcomes of statistical analyses;- interpret (processed) omics analysis results using domain knowledge, data mining (commonly used biological databases ) and literature mining;- extract knowledge from the data and synthesize this into a (possible) biological story and compose new research questions and hypotheses based on this (data-driven).",""]
