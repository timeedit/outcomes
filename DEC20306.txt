["DEC20306","Rural Households and Livelihood Strategies","4WD","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to explain, apply and evaluate different theoretical perspectives to rural household behaviour and livelihood strategies. In particular, this means that the student is able to: 1. Explain and apply microeconomic theory, sociological/anthropological approaches and policy-based perspectives for analysing rural household behaviour and livelihood strategies, and evaluate their usefulness and limitations;2. Explain why and how gender-differentiated access to assets and division of labour shape household production, consumption, labour decisions and livelihood strategies; 3. Analyse how rural households decide upon income diversification (esp. migration) as a livelihood strategy, taking into account gender relations, meanings of mobility and connectivity, and market imperfections, and explain how migration may affect farm production;4. Use farm household economics and sociological/anthropological theoretical perspectives on livelihoods and resources to analyse degradation and conservation of natural resources (esp. land and water) in relation to livelihoods;5. Analyse why risk aversion affects rural household production decisions and how risk and vulnerability transform and shape livelihood strategies;6. Make an integrated analysis of the concepts, theories and perspectives discussed during the entire course;7. Work together in a multidisciplinary group and prepare, present and defend a jointly prepared brief report.",""]
