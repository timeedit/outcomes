["EZO51306","Marine Life","6WD-2ND-HALF","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- recognize the wide diversity of lower plants and animals, each with its own characteristics, in the marine niches where they function as living systems;- understand how organisms of increasingly complex design (from protista to mammals) perform similar functions: feeding, respiration, excretion, transport, locomotion, coordination and integration, reproduction;- understand how organisms with a similar design survive in different environments (adaptive radiation): the biological options and constraints in adapting to marine conditions and utilizing marine resources;- understand the processes and mechanisms that shaped biological diversity during the individual (ontogenetic) and the evolutionary (phylogenetic) time scale;- understand the impact of abiotic factors (exposure, substrate, water content, salinity, temperature, oxygen content) and biotic factors (community with other plants and animals) on structure, function and behavior of organisms;- be able to apply the acquired theoretical knowledge in field conditions;- develop skills for research: observation, problem definition, analysis (including dissection), synthesis, discussion and reporting (both orally, by writing and by drawing).",""]
