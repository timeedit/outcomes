["MAT33306","Data Science for Plant Breeding and Genetics","6WD-1ST-HALF","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- describe in general terms the commonly-used and novel systems to collect phenotypic data (multi-environment trials, platforms, imaging) and how do these systems play a role in characterizing plant adaptation;- describe the basic principles of experimental design and apply them (CRD, RCBD, incomplete block designs, alpha and row-column designs, p-reps, split plot designs. - explain the general principles of ANOVA and mixed models, fit a variance components model by REML (using R) and interpret the output to characterize G×E in terms of .genotype by location, genotype by year, genotype by management, etc.;- formulate linear-bilinear models (Finlay-Wilkinson, AMMI and GGE), use R to fit the models, and interpret the general output from the analysis, the estimated parameters and relevant (bi-)plots;- explain the principles of single- and multi-environment genomic predictions and formulate the corresponding mixed models;- explain G×E in relation to consistency of QTLs;- discuss the utility of crop growth models to characterize environments over time.",""]
