["FPH20306","Food Physics","3WD","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- analyse colloidal structures existing in foods belonging to various categories (solutions, dispersions, emulsions, gels, foam);- analyse the colloidal interactions acting between these colloidal structures;- understand qualitatively and quantitatively how these interactions affect the stability and macroscopic properties of common food products;- understand how stability and properties of common food products can be influenced by changing experimental parameters, such as temperature, pH, or salt concentration;- perform practical experiments to test stability and properties of common food products.",""]
