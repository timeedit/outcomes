["MAT26306","Control Engineering","4WD","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- solve differential equations by using Laplace transformations;- translate differential equations into transfer functions;- derive stability and response characteristics from transfer functions;- design, analyse, and tune PID controllers by using step response and root-locus methods;- design, analyse, and tune PID controllers by using frequency response method, Bode, and Nyquist;- improve the performance of controllers;- analyse a process and design a controller configuration;- use special types of controllers as feedforward, and cascade controllers;- propose the controller structure for multiple-input multiple-output systems;- apply these concepts during practical exercises and a design case.",""]
