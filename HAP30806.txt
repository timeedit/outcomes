["HAP30806","Brain, Hormones and Metabolism","5MO","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- interpret and analyse how neurons in the brain communicate with each other and how these signals influence peripheral target organs and vise versa;- explain the role of the AMPA and NMDA receptors in memory formation, and explain the molecular basis of memory-related illnesses;- explain the role of mitochondria in neural cell function and how it relates to brain diseases;- interpret and analyse how the brain controls skeletal muscle function, and how this is altered by fatigue and aging;- analyse and integrate the effects of peripheral hunger and satiety signals to feeding circuits in the brain with specific emphasis on the hypothalamic neurons;- explain the role of metabolism and its link to the gut-brain axis; - setup an experiment to demonstrate the GDF15 response in multiple cell types in response to a trigger and interpret the results",""]
