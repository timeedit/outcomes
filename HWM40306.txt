["HWM40306","Catchment and Climate Hydrology","5MO","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:analyse field observations to conceptualize hydro(geo)logically and climatologically complex catchments;analyse hydrological systems (processes and medium) of catchments in various climatological and hydrogeological settings;evaluate precipitation-runoff relationships at various temporal and spatial scales;apply several conceptual models using historical data from a number of European catchments, incl. a detailed interpretation of model simulation results and inter-comparison of models;assess outcomes from these models to explore catchment management options, incl. prediction of hydrological extremes (floods and droughts) and assessing effects of global change;construct models of stochastic and deterministic nature.",""]
