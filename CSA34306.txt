["CSA34306","Ecological Modelling and Data Analysis in R","2AF","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- understand major concepts in ecological model fitting and data analysis in R, as presented in Bolker (2008);- apply major concepts in ecological model fitting and data analysis in R, as presented in Bolker (2008);- analyse a real-life ecological problem in terms of the key variables characterizing the ecological system;- evaluate the appropriateness of competing models for the same data, based on underlying mechanistic assumptions and information theoretic criteria;- create, using R code, a model for an ecological system, fit the model to data, choose the best model using information criteria, and address a real-life ecological question;- students develop an active learning style, that helps to acquire skills and insight in a broad sense. Those skills include, but are not limited to, articulating questions, engaging in class discussion, and presenting theory to peers.",""]
