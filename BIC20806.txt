["BIC20806","Enzymology","3WD, 6OTHER","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- describe the basic chemical principles that underlie the enzymatic catalysis and perform basic calculations;- explain how enzymes catalyze chemical reactions and discuss what factors can influence enzyme activity;- use experimentally obtained results of chemical and enzymatic reactions to calculate kinetic parameters of the reaction;- classify enzymes based on their structural features and explain how these features influence their catalytic properties;- execute proper handling and purification of proteins in a laboratory setting;- perform enzymatic assays and use experimentally obtained results to calculate specific activity and yield;- given the physico-chemical properties of a protein, design a multi-step purification method that can be used to purify that protein.",""]
