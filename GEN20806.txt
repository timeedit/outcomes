["GEN20806","Plant Biotechnology","2MO","Students are expected to gain theoretical knowledge on plant biotechnology and to acquire practical skills in basic plant biotechnology techniques. This means that after successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- understand the principles behind the isolation of genes and transfer to plants, based on general understanding of gene structure and expression;- describe the analysis of gene expression and ways to regulate this;- understand the complexity of several important plant traits and the consequences&nbsp;of genetic modification to modify plant traits;- use genomic databases available through internet to collect and analyse plant gene sequences using bioinformatics tools;- gather and interpret relevant scientific literature on plant biotechnology topics;- apply molecular genetic and molecular biology techniques for DNA isolation, plant transformation and analysis of gene expression patterns in transgenic plants;- evaluate and discuss the (im)possibilities of plant biotechnology applications from a technical and a societal point of view.",""]
