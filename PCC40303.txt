["PCC40303","Coupled Processes in Soft Matter","6AF-1ST-HALF","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- relate and apply concepts from physical chemistry to coupled processes in different kinds of soft matter systems;- assess relevant modelling parameters, rate-limiting factors, time and length scales;- demonstrate a clear understanding of (thermodynamic) concepts underlying the coupling of processes;- construct computer models in COMSOL, including selection of the correct boundary conditions and meshing issues to describe and predict the outcome of coupled processes;- analyse and evaluate the results of the computer modelling in the context of the underlying theory.",""]
