The models are applicable to, but not limited to, to water treatment facilities, and are also of importance in a much more general context such as chemical facilities in general, and to describe elements within the natural environment, such as lakes and rivers; - set up mathematical reactor models that you can subsequently apply for practical aims such as process and equipment (re-)design, process operation and control, and for cost engineering/energy saving (optimization) studies. These more practical applications are not as such part of the course. Instead the course focuses on the underlying mathematical framework and descriptions for the physical and chemical phenomena; - solve systems described by a set of ordinary differential equations for analysis; - analyze the stationary conditions of systems described by a set of partial differential equations; - critically check existing chemical reactor and transport models in water technology, assess the validity of the mathematical approaches, and find possible errors; - recognize and understand the role of different reactor operational modes (single phase vs. multiphase; steady-state vs. dynamic; etc.) for conversion, selectivity, and removal efficiency, and thus the importance of these choices for an optimal reactor design with the most optimum recovery of valuable compounds, least energy consumption, etc.;- quantitative understanding of mass transport and reaction of ionic species (metal ions, protein) in water processes.",
