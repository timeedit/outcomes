["BCT20306","Modelling Dynamic Systems","2MO","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- create a mathematical systems model from an oral or written problem description of a simple system (0-d, well-mixed) through application of scientific knowledge and measurement data;- translate mathematical systems models into differential equation models and to solve and analyse these models;- understand and recognize the different types of variables of a systems model written in state-space form;- approximate non-linear systems by linearized systems;- determine and compute system behaviour, equilibriums, and system properties such as stability;- represent elementary linear systems by means of a state-space model and convert one into the other;- apply parameter estimation to estimate unknown parameters of a mathematical systems model in state-space form.",""]
