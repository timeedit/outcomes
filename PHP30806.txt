["PHP30806","Molecular Aspects of Bio-interactions","2AF","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- understand the molecular basis of interactions between plants and viruses, micro-organisms, nematodes, insects, parasitic plants, symbiotic bacteria and fungi, as well as between arthropods;- understand the complexity of the repertoire of defence mechanisms that plants utilize to (directly or indirectly) counteract attackers;- comprehend how attackers invade plants and reproduce, with emphasis on the function of certain proteins in these processes;- comprehend how symbiotic organisms interact with plants without triggering defense responses;- understand how insights into bio-interactions can be exploited to the benefit of plants;- explain different gene regulatory elements in the sex determination cascade of insects; - explain the symbiotic relations between insects and (endo)symbionts and the mechanism of reproductive manipulations induced by endosymbionts;- perform experiments in the field of biotic interactions;- write a report about the experiments in the format of a scientific publication.",""]
