["PCC23303","Introductory Thermodynamics B","4MO","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to: - Describe simplifications that make thermodynamics quantitative;- Identify thermodynamic concepts in real life applications;- Interpret real life processes and systems in terms of thermodynamic concepts;- Perform calculations of thermodynamic properties (e.g. heat, work, energy, entropy, molar Gibbs energy) for ideal gases, pure substances, (non-) ideal mixtures and electrochemical systems;- Calculate the change in the molar Gibbs energy of reactions and apply this to phase transitions, equilibria and chemical reactions; - Understand and work with functions of several variables (regarding total derivatives and partial derivatives).",""]
