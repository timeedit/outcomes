["EZO30306","Developmental Biology of Animals","6WD-1ST-HALF","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- summarize the characteristics of a range of popular vertebrate and invertebrate model species;- recognize and interpret microscopic sections through the embryonic stages of three vertebrate model species in developmental biology: zebrafish, chicken, and mouse; - understand and explain the early embryonic development, especially cell-cell signaling;- understand how postnatal development affects behavior;- understand how embryonic development is related to micro- and macroevolutionary changes;- understand and use some molecular techniques (e.g. DNA extraction, RNA extraction, gene expression (qPCR, ISH);- design and execute an experiment, to collect and analyse data, to critically reflect on the results (discussion) and to report the experiment to peers and teachers.",""]
