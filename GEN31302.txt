["GEN31302","Population Genetics","2DL","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to: - understand the historical relationship between evolutionary theory and population genetics; - comprehend the importance of studying the behaviour and dynamics of genetic variation in extant populations to understand evolutionary processes; - define and describe the important population genetic concepts, natural selection, mutation, migration, and genetic drift; - understand and mathematically describe how these concepts relate to evolution and how they affect genetic variation; - apply these population genetic concepts to problems related to the genetic dynamics of natural, captive and artificially selected populations; - infer consequences of population history for the current genetic characteristics of populations, and vice versa, to infer population history from current data.",""]
