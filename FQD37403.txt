["FQD37403","Predicting Food Quality - Solving food science problems by modelling","3DL","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:        - explain and infer the nature of food quality attributes in relation to food quality;- classify and infer food quality attribute changes from thermodynamic and kinetic principles;- calculate uncertainties in parameters and predictions in case of kinetic models; - practice with the nature and properties of mathematical equations relevant for food quality;- deduce models, parameters and model predictions and their uncertainties;- assess competing models on their ability to predict;- appraise models on food quality that are applied in food science literature.",""]
