["SLM33306","Advanced Hydrological Systems Analysis","6WD-1ST-HALF","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to: apply the principal physical-mathematical descriptions of the different hydrological processes in an integrated manner;appraise the strengths and weaknesses of several modelling concepts of the different hydrological processes;analyse the hydrological system in terms of physical-mathematical expressions; implement coupled-systems equations into computer implementations;critically evaluate simulation algorithms, contained in commercial packages, to simulate coupled hydrological systems;develop a hydrological model for a real world case study;assess parameter uncertainty for the case-study models.",""]
