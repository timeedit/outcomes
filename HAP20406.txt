["HAP20406","Human and Animal Biology II, dissection free","1MO","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to: - describe the structural organization of vertebrate organ systems, including relevant nomenclature; - explain the function and regulation of these vertebrate organ systems; - explain the interaction between morphology, function and regulation of organ systems; - describe the role of evolution in the continuity and diversity of animal life and arrange the evolutionary relationships of a number of main animal taxa; - demonstrate a conceptual understanding of the major vertebrate groups and their biodiversity, and adaptations; - apply scientific techniques to study gross anatomy (dissection free techniques), microanatomy (microscopy) and physiology (laboratory techniques and experimental set-ups for in vivo measurements);- apply the obtained knowledge of the function and regulation of the vertebrate organ systems in problem-based cases;- evaluate scientific literature focused on the adaptation of anatomy, physiology of organ systems and behaviour of animals to changing internal and external conditions.",""]
