["ABG20306","Animal Breeding and Genetics","1AF","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:describe the steps that need to be taken when setting up a breeding program;calculate and interpret genetic parameters such as heritability and repeatability using simple statistical methods;calculate probabilities of inheritance for monogenic traits using pedigree information;calculate family relationships and inbreeding coefficients in simple pedigrees;estimate breeding values and their accuracy from phenotype information and family relationships for simple situations;explain how DNA markers can be used to estimate breeding values and increase genetic gain in breeding programs;predict and evaluate response to selection and genetic diversity in breeding programs.",""]
