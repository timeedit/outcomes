["HWM23806","Geophysical Fluid Mechanics","2AF","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to: understand the derivation of the equations governing fluid dynamics; apply theoretical concepts in geophysical fluid mechanics, by using an appropriate mass, momentum or energy balance (including an appropriate selection of the relevant terms in the equations); analyse dimensions in a geophysical problem and derive scale relations based on dynamic similarity; explain alternative concepts of modelling fluid dynamics; identify the most important characteristics of a laminar or turbulent fluid flow with or without system rotation.",""]
