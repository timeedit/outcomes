["BPE20806","Separation Process Design","5MO","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- identify the rate-affecting phenomena in separators discussed in the course;- select the best approach to design the operation between a rate- and an equilibrium-based- set up the balance equations required for the design of a separator, analyse and solve them;- identify the degrees of freedom in the design of a separator and explain their effect;- evaluate the consequences of design choices, also in combinations of separators;- optimize the operation of a separator, selecting the most appropriate performance criterion.",""]
