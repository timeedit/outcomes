["BNT40303","Advanced Inorganic Chemistry","4MO","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- understand the importance of inorganic chemistry (in particular d- and f-block elements);- demonstrate understanding of Crystal-Field, Ligand-Field theory and spin-orbit coupling;- relate (photo)physical optical and magnetic properties of metal complexes;- assess heteronuclear 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy in characterization of metal complexes;- assess coordination chemistry to topics in nanomaterials and catalysis;- synthesize transition metal coordination complexes and characterize them by 1D and 2D MR and optical spectroscopic techniques",""]
