["PCC34303","Statistical Thermodynamics","3MO","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- understand and apply the machinery of statistical thermodynamics;- work with Boltzmann distributions;- formulate partition functions and extract measurable quantities from these;- solve simple partition functions and have insight in strategies to approximate more complex ones, in particular the mean-field approximation;- understand how computer simulations can help to evaluate molecularly realistic models;- understand how measurable quantities can be extracted from computer simulations.",""]
