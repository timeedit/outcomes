["CSA10806","Introduction Quantitative Agroecology","5AF","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:a. Crop Production EcologyExplain how radiation, temperature and crop characteristics determine the potential growth, development and production of crops in agro-ecosystems;Explain how a-biotic (water and nutrients) and biotic (pest, diseases and weeds) production constraints interfere with potential crop production;Understand the ecology and biology of agricultural weeds;Learn how to apply a descriptive model for the yield reduction of a crop following from competition of weeds;b. Systems analysis and simulation:Master elementary facets of systems analysis and simulation, such as feedback, time coefficient, relational diagram, analysis of units and numerical integration methods, the state-rate approach;Analyze systems in terms of states, rates and driving variables;Design and construct models for the analysis of simple systems;Understand the differences between descriptive and mechanistic models;c. Sustainability:Analyze the sustainability issues of a cropping system;Explain how the sustainability and environmental impact of a cropping system can be evaluated;Explain which physical, biological, economic and social factors co-determine actual cropping systems and their dynamics;Analyze the tension between different objectives of a crop rotation",""]
