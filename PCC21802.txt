["PCC21802","Introductory Thermodynamics A","2OTHER","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to: - describe simplifications that make thermodynamics quantitative- identify thermodynamic concepts in real life applications;- interpret real life processes and systems in terms of thermodynamic concepts;- perform calculations of thermodynamic properties (e.g. heat, work, energy, entropy, molar Gibbs energy) for ideal gases, pure substances, (non-) ideal mixtures and electrochemical systems; - calculate the change in the molar Gibbs energy of reactions and apply this to phase transitions, equilibria and chemical reactions.
