["CSA20806","Population and Systems Ecology","4WD","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:_x000d_ - state the founding principles of basic ecological models, and explain the meaning and units of variables and parameters;_x000d_ - explain the relationship between basic structure elements of population systems (e.g. unlimited resources versus resource limitation, feedbacks, predatory or competitive species interactions, spatial spread), and the resulting dynamics;_x000d_ - calculate the dominant eigenvalue, eigenvector, and sensitivities and elasticities of a Leslie matrix model, using pencil and paper, and interpret these mathematical results in terms of the associated real world phenomena;_x000d_ - calculate equilibria and isoclines in 2 species dynamic systems, and graphically analyse stability;_x000d_ - apply simple mathematics on general ecological principles such as species-area relationships, competition, meta-population theory and nutrient cycling illustrate species adaptations to environmental conditions and their feedbacks to ecological processes at the level of communities, ecosystems and landscapes;_x000d_ - interpret life history traits and predator search strategies in terms of fitness and evolutionary selection pressures;_x000d_ - illustrate threats to biodiversity using ecological theory, and describe and explain the consequences for ecosystem functioning and the ecological background of nature management, natural resource management and nature policy.",""]
