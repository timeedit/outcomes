["MIB11306","Microbiology for Nutrition and Health","6AF","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- explain the importance of the large diversity of microorganisms for development and sustainment of life on earth, including their effects on gastro-intestinal health, food safety and food quality;- explain that structure and function of enzymes are a link between chemistry and the living cell that underlies biological diversity;- explain the following basic principles of metabolism of (micro)organisms: manipulation of free energy by enzymes to direct metabolism, importance of oxidation-reduction reactions for extracting energy from organic and inorganic substrates, glycolysis, citric acid cycle and respiratory chain;- compare the basal metabolism with glucose as a model substrate in (micro)organisms in the presence and absence of external electron acceptors;- summarize a number of microbial interactions in specific ecosystems, with special emphasis on the human gastro-intestinal tract and food products;- exemplify the influence of a number of environmental factors on microbial growth and activity in general, and on foodborne microorganisms, and the human intestinal microbiome specifically; - perform simple microbial experiments with emphasis on aseptic techniques for transfer and handling of microorganisms;- enrich and isolate microorganisms under defined environmental conditions;- perform experiments to test the presence of specific pathogens and spoilage bacteria  in a number of food products and on surfaces.",""]
