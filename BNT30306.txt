["BNT30306","BioNanoTechnology; Nanomedicine","3WD","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- understand nanomaterials, surface-functionalization, covalent/non-covalent interactions, supramolecular chemistry;- describe how natural and non-natural nanostructures can play a role in toxicity and medicine;- describe different classes of nanoparticles, from solid metal particles to oxides, semiconductor and nanotube material from dendrimers and micelles;- discriminate between diagnostic, therapeutic, theragnostic and multimodal nanoparticles;- discriminate surface functionalization strategies by covalent and non-covalent chemistry;- plan synthesis and chemical/biochemical functionalization of nanomedicinal compounds;- investigate the interaction of nano-sized material with biologically relevant molecules in (microfluidic or flat-surface) devices;- summarize and review scientific literature in the field of (bio)nanotechnology/nanomedicine and critically reflect on the use of schemes/cartoons and the scales therein.",""]
