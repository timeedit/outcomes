["SGL32806","Soil and Landscape Variability","3WD","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to: describe variability in and relationships between soil and landscape properties with statistical measures; infer dominant soil and landscape processes from these statistical measures; analyse how variability propagates through simple environmental process models, using simple mechanistic models; design data collection and analysis strategies that account for spatial variability in soil and landscape properties; analyse data collected in the field to answer a self-defined research question.",""]
