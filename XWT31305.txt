["XWT31305","Bioreactor Design","2WD +  3WD","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- construct mathematical models bases on balances for elements, reactants or products, combined with appropriate equations for conversion and transport kinetics, and able to use these models to achieve the goals below, i.e. able to:- design bioreactors with a single phase, for continuous and batch operation;- design bioreactors with mass transfer between two phases (gas and liquid) characterized by ideal flow pattern (ideal plug flow, ideal mixed, co-current and counter-current), for continuous and batch operation;- design bioreactors with diffusion into cell aggregates surrounded by a single or a two phases which exchange mass and with different flow-patterns (ideal plug flow, ideal mixed, co-current and counter-current) for continuous and batch operation;- design photo-bioreactors with mass transfer between two phases characterized by ideal flow pattern (ideal plug flow, ideal mixed, co-current and counter-current), only for continuous reactors in steady state;- handle various expressions for the intrinsic reaction kinetics for all reactors above;- apply judicious simplifications to a reactor design model for all reactors above, to allow analytical solution;- analyse scale-up effects and physical limits in the design;- analyse differences between reactor types and modes of operation, and exploit these differences for various design goals.",""]
