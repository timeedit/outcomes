["HWM24306","Environmental Hydraulics","1AF","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:calculate hydrostatic and hydrodynamic pressures and resulting forces on structures;calculate water level and flow velocity in uniform open channels;calculate surface level profiles for gradually varying non-uniform flow (backwater curve, draw down curve), with the aim to know the consequences of measures in currents and streams;calculate energy losses in closed pipe systems using friction coefficients and loss coefficients;measure hydraulic variables in the laboratory and apply theory to the observations;design a water course (planform, cross-section and structures) for a case from current water management practice, analyse data from a numerical model and evaluate uncertainties and assumptions;execute a project, including setting up a work plan, time planning, presentation and report writing.",""]
