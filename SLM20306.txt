["SLM20306","Land & Water Engineering","2MO","After successful completion of this course students are able to independently apply their understanding of surface irrigation systems and soil and water conservation measures to situations where they analyse physical characteristics of such land and water systems. More specifically, students are expected to be able to: show knowledge of the basic physical relations determining water flow and sediment-transport in canals and through structures;observe, schematise and measure the performance of a physical water system or part thereof;design (select, calculate and dimension) canals and structures;show basic knowledge on soil mechanics;analyse rainfall-runoff relation and estimate a design discharge;select and design soil conservation measures to reduce soil erosion to an acceptable level;select and design rain water harvesting measures for domestic use and crop production.",""]
