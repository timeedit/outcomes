["FPE31306","Transfer Processes","2AF","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to: - analyse thermodynamic phase equilibria from the chemical potential of a component in the phases involved;- evaluate the feasibility of a design of the process using thermodynamic equilibrium models;- apply the Maxwell-Stefan theory and derive a general diffusion equation based on this theory;- analyse various transfer processes in food- and bio- and environmental technology by application of the general diffusion equation;- design and evaluate the required size or capacity of transfer equipment in a given process design, e.g. a membrane process, packed-bed absorber or adsorption column.",""]
