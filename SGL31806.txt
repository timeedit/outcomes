["SGL31806","Field Training Geosciences","6WD-2ND-HALF","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to: describe the spatial variation in soil classification and properties in the Alora region as a function of geology, geomorphology and land use; predict the spatial variation in soil properties in similar regions based on geographic reasoning; design a catena-based sampling strategy for mapping of soils and land use; adequately use modern geo-referenced soil mapping techniques; analyse soil maps in terms of i) suitability for different land uses or ii) as input in modelling (e.g. soil redistribution).",""]
