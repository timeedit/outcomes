["FPE35803","Food Structuring - Structuring by temperature, designing edible barriers","1DL-1ST-HALF","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- explain the current temperature-based processes used for the production of complex food products; - explain the relevant physics related to those crystallization and glass transition; - design relevant temperature-based processes for complex food products;- explain the consequences of differences in chemical potential for transport phenomena occurring insideÂ multiphase food products;- analyse the role of the chemical potential in those products.",""]
