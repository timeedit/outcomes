["CSA10306","Crops and Cropping Systems","6WD-2ND-HALF","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:-&nbsp;name common crop and grassland plants and/or their harvested parts by their common name and genus, and describe their use, crop type and climate zone;-&nbsp;identify a selection of the most important crop and grassland species and their products by using vegetative, generative and other characteristics and by applying biological knowledge, and describe their value for use, quality characteristics, product type, reproduction characteristics and cultivation characteristics;-&nbsp;describe and use important terms and parameters in the field of study and name the approximate value of the parameters;-&nbsp;describe which ecological processes play an important role in the functioning of agro-ecosystems, and which factors determine the diversity in cropping systems in different climate zones;-&nbsp;explain how radiation, water, temperature, soil and crop affect different ecological processes in agro-ecosystems at different integration levels;&nbsp;-&nbsp;apply the obtained knowledge to quantify the functional relationships in agro-ecosystems, especially with regard to external factors and nutrient cycles; and to analyse cropping systems.&nbsp;",""]
