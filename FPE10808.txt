["FPE10808","Food Production Chains","6OTHER","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to: - identify various production processes in food technology; - recognizes several basic processes in the food production chain and know the reason why the various steps in the production process are present; - calculate various parameters in simple process designs; - recognise and classify situations in which typical decision problems occur in food supply chains; - analyse the description of a decision problem and formulate a quantitative model to optimize i.e. support decision making in (food) production chains; - demonstrate a basic understanding of the role of the consumer in food production chains and how this translates to supply chain management;- quantitatively describe the change in quality of food products along the chain and build simple kinetic models for its prediction;- Integrate knowledge of food processing, food quality, logistics and marketing/consumer behavior.",""]
