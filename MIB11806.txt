["MIB11806","Microbiology & Toxicology","5AF","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to: - explain the importance of the large diversity of microorganisms for development and sustainment of life on earth;- explain the following basic principles of metabolism of (micro)organisms: manipulation of free energy by enzymes to direct metabolism, importance of oxidation-reduction reactions for extracting energy from organic and inorganic substrates, glycolysis, citric acid cycle and respiratory chain;- compare the basal metabolism with glucose as a model substrate in (micro)organisms in the presence and absence of external electron acceptors;- summarize a number of microbial interactions in specific ecosystems;- exemplify the influence of environmental factors on microbial activity in the cycling of nutrients, like carbon, nitrogen, sulfur and iron;- practice a set of basic microbial experiments with emphasis on aseptic techniques for transfer and handling of microorganisms;- enrich and isolate microorganisms under defined environmental conditions;- summarize important generalized toxicological concepts underlying toxic responses following exposure to toxic chemicals;- understand some important mechanisms (modes of action) of toxic chemicals that underlie the adverse effects observed to important toxic chemicals in food and the environment;- understand the basic principles of risk assessment of chemicals in food and the environment.",""]
