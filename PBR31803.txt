["PBR31803","Genetics","2DL","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:_x000d_- analyse questions and problems on all aspects of Mendelian genetics, including deviations from standard segregation ratios;_x000d_- apply quantitative and population genetics concepts to infer the effects of selection, non-random mating, mutation, genetic drift on forward genetic screens;_x000d_- describe the relation between genes, chromosomes and DNA and the concept of genome structure;_x000d_- understand evolutionary concepts explaining the origin of biological complexity, and processes shaping the genome, such as horizontal gene transfer, genome duplications, hybridisations, transposition; _x000d_- apply quantitative and biosystematic approaches to evaluate genetic structure and diversity of populations, as well as phylogenetic analyses.",""]
