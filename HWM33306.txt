["HWM33306","Coastal Oceanography and Delta Geology","2MO","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- understand the large-scale responses of delta build up and decay in response to upstream and downstream forcing;- infer how the morphology of deltas is affected by dominant processes;- analyse a time-series of water levels or flow velocity adopting a harmonic analysis approach;- examine processes of estuarine circulation in delta channels;- investigate salt intrusion and river plume spreading;- evaluate the consequences of human activity to delta evolution, and reflect on potential routes for sustainable delta management.",""]
