["ANU30806","Animal Nutrition and Physiology","4WD","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- summarize and compare the anatomy and function of digestive systems in farm and companion animal species and to explain the consequences for the digestion process of macronutrients;- explain the intermediary metabolism of macronutrients, i.e. carbohydrates, fats, and proteins;- demonstrate the role of the different steps laboratory analysis of nitrogen and starch, and explain the principles of the determination of macronutrients in feedstuffs and animal (waste) products;- explain and compare techniques to measure digestion, fermentation, nutrient passage through the intestinal tract and energy and protein metabolism;- use mathematical modelling techniques to quantify nutrient fluxes, providing insight into the physiology of nutrient digestion, absorption, and utilization;- integrate knowledge on diet composition, digestion of macronutrients, comparative anatomy, and intermediary metabolism to predict the effects of changes in nutritional strategies.",""]
