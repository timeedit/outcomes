["ESA31806","Environmental Assessments of Nutrient and Pollution Management","3WD","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recall and explain main interacting environmental impacts of food & energy production on soil, water and air quality and the potential of management options to reduce those impacts·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Explain the choice and impacts of different model approaches in view of differences in pollutant behaviour and model aim.·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understand the principles of agent based models and the related environmental impacts in coupled social-environmental systems·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluate the usefulness of environmental models in integrated environmental assessments.&nbsp;·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assess the relevance of different management options to reconcile nutrient use in food production with protection of soil, water and air quality·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Design an integrated environmental assessment model in terms of model specifications (model inputs, outputs, system boundaries etc.) and model linkages.More details on the second and fourth learning outcome are present in the course guide.",""]
