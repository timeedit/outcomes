["WRM51304","Emotions in Debates on Natural Resources","4OTHER +  5OTHER +  6OTHER","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- understand how do different knowledge traditions engage with and conceptualise emotions, and how the emotional solidarity is the turf around which political identities are imagined, alliances are forged, socio-cultural subjectivities are formed, and knowledge of the world is created- analyse the way social movements around resource conflicts are driven by indignation, fear, hope, a sense of right and wrong, or “how passion matters”- rethink our relationship with nature and animals in the times of extinction, humanitarian crises, and an urgent need to rethink agriculture- understand how affective relations between humans and non-humans are formed and their implications for collaborative research in the life science- examine developmental practices not as success or failure but as a matter of gaps, dislocations and blind-spots – development as contradictory and seemingly ‘irrational practices- understand feminist approaches to Affects and Subjectivities in the practice of “commoning” -- collectively managing a resource, knowledge and/or property.",""]
