["FEM31806","Models for Ecological Systems","3WD","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:1. Understand, apply and evaluate the conceptual and mathematical tools for modelling ecological systems:1.1 Understand system analysis concepts and apply tools such as Forrester diagrams and state-flow diagrams;1.2 Understand mathematical tools that act as the mathematical building blocks for models of ecological systems: algebraic equations, ordinary differential equations, analytical integration;1.3 Understand and apply numerical integration, state and rate variables, feedback mechanisms, and evaluate time coefficients;1.4 Understand mathematical tools to evaluate model behavior and perform quality checks: time step analysis, unit analysis, sensitivity analysis, equilibrium analysis, mass balance checks.2. Implement and evaluate mini-models for ecological systems in an R-environment:2.1 Apply basic R skills to manage, describe and visualize data, apply basic data and plotting functions, write functions and set up structured code to model ecological systems;2.2 Implement a mathematical mini-model for an ecological system in an R environment, using all explained conceptual and mathematical building blocks (apply tools from learning outcome 1);2.3 Evaluate the behavior and quality of the mini-model by applying all model checks (apply tools from learning outcome 1).3. Adapt, test and evaluate the behavior and quality (strengths and limitations) of an existent model that includes components of an ecological system to address an ecological and societal problem:3.1 Adapt an existing mini-model and tailor the model to a specific problem;3.2 Test the quality of adapted mini-model by applying all quality checks (apply tools from learning outcome 1);3.3 Run sensitivity analysis and calibrate parameters where needed for this adapted model;3.4 Define, run and evaluate scenarios for a real-world ecological/societal problem.",""]
