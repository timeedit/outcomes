["CBI20306","Cell Biology and Health","3WD","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- understand the basic principles in immunology and mechanisms modulating the immune response, among which suppression by viruses and toxic agents, stimulation by vaccines and toxic agents and immunological disturbances;- understand the basic principles in virology and mechanisms underlying viral infections and the subsequent diseases, among which influenza, hiv, classical swine fever and cancer;- understand the basic principles in toxicological risk assessment and mechanisms underlying adverse health effects caused by toxic agents with emphasis on cancer, immunotoxicity and developmental and reproductive toxicity;- critically read and summarizeÂ literature and finally draw recommendations and clarify your opinion with respect to the given topic in written and oral form; - understand key immunological, toxicological and virological aspects of cell biological health problems in humans and in animals; - apply cell biological techniques including immunocytochemistry, flow cytometry and measurement of respiratory burst activity with the aim to understand the basic principles of immunology;- apply cell biological techniques including cell culture, light microscopy, cytochemistry, electrophoresis and Western blot analysis with the aim to understand the basic principles of virology;- apply cell biological techniques including in vitro cell culture and bio-assay analysis with the aim to understand the basic principles of toxicology.",""]
