["FCH20806","Food Chemistry","2MO","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- recognize the molecular structures of the most common food components and their reaction products;- recognize and understand the generic functional and chemical properties of the most common food components;- understand the chemical reactions occurring during food processing;- understand how reactive groups of food components play an important role in chemical reactions;- describe the influence of processing conditions on chemical reaction and on the properties of food components;- describe the effect of chemical reactions on the characteristics of food in a qualitative sense;- apply generic mathematical concepts on experimental data to make quantitative judgments of the effect of reactions on the quality of food;- choose between the most common analytical methods and techniques to analyse specific food compounds;- conduct experiments to analyse the effect of processing on food compounds;- interpret and scientifically report on the results of these experiments.",""]
