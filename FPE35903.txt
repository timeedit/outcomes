["FPE35903","Food Structuring - Structuring by deformation, properties of interfacial systems","1DL-2ND-HALF","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- explain the current deformation-based processes used for the production of multiphase food products;- explain the relevant physics related to those processes;- design relevant deformation-based processes for structured food products;- explain the physical properties of liquid interfaces in multiphase food products;- analyse the relation between the physical properties and stability of structured food products and their structure at various scales.",""]
