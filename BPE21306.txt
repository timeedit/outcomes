["BPE21306","Bioreactor Design","2AF","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:  - design reactors with mass transfer between two ideally mixed fluid phases, for continuous, fed-batch, batch operation;  - design reactors with mass, heat or product transfer between an ideally mixed fluid phase and a fluid phase moving in ideal plug flow, for continuous, fed-batch, batch operation;  - design photo-bioreactors with mass transfer between two ideally mixed fluid phases;  - handle various expressions for the intrinsic reaction kinetics for all reactors above;  - apply judicious simplifications to a reactor design model for all reactors above, to allow analytical solution;  - analyse differences between reactor types and modes of operation, and exploit these differences for various design goals. In the context of this course, design is defined as:  - the construction of mathematical models based on balances for elements, reactants or products, combined with appropriate equations for conversion and transport kinetics;  - the use of these models to find allowed or required flow rates, concentrations, conversion rates or vessel volumes;  Students should be able to complete these design tasks independently and without access to materials used during the course or similar materials from other sources.",""]
