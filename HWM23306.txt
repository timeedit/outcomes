["HWM23306","Field Research Water and Atmosphere","6WD-1ST-HALF","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to recognize, understand, quantify, analyze, explain and evaluate quantitative and qualitative processes in atmosphere, soil water, groundwater and surface water. Students are also expected to understand and apply various measurement techniques. More in detail, students are expected to be able to:design observational networks for meteorological, hydrological and water quality measurements in catchments; understand and apply state-of-the-art field methods;measure and interpret hydrometeorological, hydrological and water quality measurements in catchments;combine physical catchment properties and apply hydrological and meteorological conceptual models;analyze and explain the relationship between water quantity and water quality of small hydrological basins.
