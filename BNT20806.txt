["BNT20806","Bio-Inorganic Chemistry","6OTHER","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- understand the importance of inorganic chemistry (in particular d- and f-block elements) to biological systems;- construct molecular orbital (MO) diagrams of metal-ligand complexes;- relate three acid-base definitions (Bronsted, Lewis, hard/soft) to metal complexes and metal oxidation states;- demonstrate understanding of Crystal-Field and Ligand-Field theory assessing coordination compound MO diagrams and interpreting Tanabe-Sugano diagrams;- relate (photo)chemical and (photo)physical properties of d-block complexes to molecular structure;- assess heteronuclear 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy in characterization of metal complexes;- judge the structural and functional roles of metal ions in metalloproteins;- assess coordination chemistry to topics in medicinal inorganic chemistry;- synthesize first-row transition metal coordination complexes and characterize them by 1D and 2D MR and optical spectroscopic techniques- relate the various appearances of homo and heteronuclear spin-spin coupling in different NMR techniques.",""]
