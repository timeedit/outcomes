["BIP24806","Atomic and Molecular Structure","1MO","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- understand how physical laws together with quantum mechanics lead to atomic orbitals;- determine characteristic properties of atomic orbitals e.g., (the expectation value of) energy, spin, angular momentum, spin-orbit coupling, etc.;- determine optical transitions of atoms and estimate magnitude of the related energy difference / frequency and wavelength of electronic transitions;- understand the electronic structure of simple molecules;- apply theory of chemical bonds for understanding/estimating molecular structures and bond stability.- understand relation between electronic structure and spectroscopic properties;",""]
