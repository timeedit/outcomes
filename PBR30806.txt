["PBR30806","Design of Plant Breeding Programmes","6WD-2ND-HALF","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- integrate theoretical and practical knowledge in a design study for a breeding program;- understand connections between the crop, breeding methods, techniques  and breeding goals;- design a breeding program for a specific crop (all along the chain from defining the specific breeding goal(s) until marketing the newly developed variety);- select parameters (parental choice, breeding strategy, population genetics, selection methods, traits of interest) that are crucial for successful practical breeding;- reflect on breeding methods and their presuppositions; justify the choices made in the breeding program and provide scientific argumentation. Consider alternatives and estimate their implications;- write both a work plan and a final report of the breeding program;- present the work plan and final breeding plan plenary.- critically evaluate presented programs of other groups.",""]
