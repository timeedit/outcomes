["GEN11806","Fundamentals of Genetics","2MO, 3WD","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:_x000d_- explain the basic genetic and molecular biological processes in eukaryotes: transmission of genetic information, the relationship between genotype and phenotype, the regulation and expression of genes, the generation of variation, the organization of genomes and genes;_x000d_- summarize the basic genetic methods: how genomes are explored, how populations are studied, how quantitative characters are studied, how genetics is applied in life sciences;_x000d_- recall tools and methods to study gene expression and to isolate, analyse and manipulate genes;_x000d_- recall and explain general genetic and molecular biological terms as these are described in the appropriate chapters of the textbook (in other words, to be able to understand and to speak the genetic and molecular biological language at a basic level);_x000d_- explain and interpret genetic experiments and observations, e.g. to recognize and analyse patterns of inheritance, gene interactions, consequences of chromosomal changes, genetic changes in populations, and quantitative characters;_x000d_- analyse and judge the use of genetics in societal questions.",""]
