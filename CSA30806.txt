["CSA30806","Research Methods in Crop Science","1AF","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- describe important methodology and good practices in crop experimentation, and explain their rationale;- list the consecutive steps needed to transform a problem to type of experimental data needed and apply them for a crop experiment;- list the iterative choices to be made in designing crop experiments and observations, explain the rationale and (statistical) consequences of these choices, choose and describe appropriate methods;- apply proper practices for sampling and data collection and show insight in the impact and pitfalls for the reliability of the outcomes;- arrange, evaluate and statistically analyse experimental data and present, interpret and describe the results of the statistical analysis of crop experiments;- compile the description and outcome of the individual research steps in a coherent high-standard report, using conventions as in scientific journals (for writing and contents).",""]
