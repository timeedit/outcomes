["AFI30806","Fisheries Ecology","4WD","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:_x000d_- identify the main vertebrate and invertebrate species in world fisheries as well as their main biological and life-history characteristics that influence their vulnerability to fisheries;_x000d_- explain how the main developments in effort and technology in the world's fisheries have influenced marine and other aquatic ecosystems over the last century;_x000d_- apply first-stage data-processing, parameter estimation, and basic statistical concepts involved in fisheries ecology;_x000d_- apply basic models of fish population dynamics, fisheries yield models, and mass-balance models using computer-supported simulations;_x000d_- assess the assumptions underlying widely-used models in fisheries ecology;_x000d_- analyse how bottom-up and top-down processes can influence marine and other aquatic communities;_x000d_- analyse the evolutionary and community effects of fishing and conservation on fished and unfished species and populations;_x000d_- construct a management advice, following a stock assessment, using the major steps used world-wide by fisheries scientists in providing the scientific base for single species management.",""]
