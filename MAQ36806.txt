["MAQ36806","Remote Sensing of Atmospheric Composition","5AF","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:understand and apply numerical principles in radiative transfer and spectroscopy;analyze the role of absorption, scattering, and propagation of radiation along the entire spectrum (UV/Vis to infrared) in climate forcing and in retrieval applications;apply contemporary satellite retrievals to monitor spatial distributions and trends, to estimate surface fluxes, and to provide constraints on atmospheric models;evaluate the potential and limitations of remote sensing for research into global change issues;demonstrate their skills in processing, visualization and analysis of remote sensing datasets.",""]
