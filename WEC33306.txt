["WEC33306","Disease Ecology","6WD-1ST-HALF","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:summarize the key features and describe the impact/relevance of different infectious diseases affecting free-living organisms;evaluate behavioral and ecological factors that affect spatio-temporal variation in disease outbreaks;make and justify predictions relating to ecological variation and host immune defenses;assess methods for studying diseases and host defenses of wild populations;design and implement an ecological study to answer a question related to diseases and host defenses;develop and analyze compartmental models and other SIR models, including through the use of programming software (e.g., R);appraise the strengths and limitations of modelling diseases and outbreaks in wild populations;compare and contrast scenarios that would and would not result in a disease outbreak;evaluate potential interventions for their capacity to control an outbreak.",""]
