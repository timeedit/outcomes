["BCT35306","Catalysis and sustainable bio-organic synthesis","5MO","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to analyze catalytic transformations simultaneously at different levels and in particular be able to:&nbsp;- analyze catalysis-related problems on different dimensions: from multi-ton scale industrial applications to an atomic level of active catalytic cites;- define and recognize the basic principles of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis; the similarities, differences and limitations of these different methods of catalysis operation;- suggest a reasonable mechanism for the catalytic transformation and methods to further prove the hypothesis;- propose methods to study and optimize the performance of the catalyst in transformations of interest;- recognize the importance of catalysis for sustainable synthesis of (bio-organic) bulk and fine chemicals and know how to incorporate catalytic steps into multistep synthetic routes;- identify the key aspects of experimental design of catalytic reactions;- perform computational modeling of catalytic system.",""]
