["WRM34306","Water System Design for Water Use from Multiple Sources","2AF","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to: - understand the needs and repercussions of irrigation activities in the context of changing land-use and water availability and institutional conditions; - analyse the relationship between irrigation water requirements for multiple land use at field level and the source of the irrigation water, including the role of rainfall; - appraise the current irrigation design challenges in the context of multiple sources of water in large irrigation systems; - design hydraulic interventions for the conjunctive use of multiple irrigation modalities in large irrigation systems; - propose institutional reforms that support the design, construction, operation and maintenance of the proposed hydraulic interventions; - assess the expected performance of the proposed interventions and analyse these for the multiple dimensions of technology, management/governance and water user perspectives; - present and defend the proposed interventions in a professional manner.",""]
