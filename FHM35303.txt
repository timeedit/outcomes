["FHM35303","Advanced Food Microbiology - Minimal Processing, Preservation and Fermentation","3DL","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- utilise and integrate knowledge on the eco-physiology and adaptive stress responses of food-associated spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms;- understand the mechanisms of minimal processing and preservation taking into account bottleneck organisms and apply preservation principles in process and product design;- understand mechanisms of microbial biofilm formation and resistance to cleaning and disinfection procedures;- use insights in microbial diversity and survival mechanisms of probiotic bacteria for enhanced product quality and composition;- understand and discuss the eco-physiology of fermented (probiotic) foods and the diversity among pre- and probiotics;- understand the principles of Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) and its application in food microbiology.",""]
