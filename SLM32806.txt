["SLM32806","Ecohydrology","2AF","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to: assess main physical habitat factors that govern vegetation growth; construct, analyze and evaluate ecohydrological feedbacks for typical biosphere environments; construct horizontal vegetation pattern formation due to spatial ecohydrological interactions; judge how soil and vegetation properties affect overland flow self-organisation; appraise how runoff and subsurface flow affect vegetation and ecosystem resilience; judge the impact of abiotic conditions on vegetation composition and diversity; understand regional interaction between vegetation, soil moisture and groundwater; analyse infiltration, root water uptake, percolation and capillary rise with Richards equation; simulate plant growth in relation to environmental conditions; analyse interception and evapotranspiration of agricultural and natural vegetation; evaluate ecohydrological models and their application in recent studies.",""]
