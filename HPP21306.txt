["HPP21306","Quantitative Aspects of Crop Production","5MO","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- think in and work with energy-, CO2-, and water balances, state and rate variables in relation to the interaction between crop and abiotic environment;- explain how abiotic factors like radiation, crop temperature, soil or substrate pF and air humidity influence crop growth and product quality;- understand models that describe crop growth, crop development and the interaction between crop and abiotic environment (physics) and can use these models to predict, depending on radiation, temperature, water and nutrient uptake, crop growth, crop development and feedback between crop and abiotic environment;- express damage by pests and diseases in crop physiological parameters and quantify this damage;- apply physical, crop physiological and crop ecological principles in both field and greenhouse cropping systems.",""]
