["FTE35806","Control Methods for Precision Farming","5MO","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- identify bottlenecks of basic control engineering techniques on precision farming systems;- apply specialized control methods to solve bottlenecks;- apply control strategies that take into account future events;- define an appropriate control objective (e.g. to maximize benefits and minimize resources);- identify sources of uncertainty and represent them mathematically;- define and compare management strategies to deal with uncertainties and disturbances in the system;- design precision control strategies to meet individual requirements (e.g. of animals / patches of land with different characteristics);- combine strategies of control with uncertainty propagation to assess performance and risks.",""]
