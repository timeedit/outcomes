["PPH10806","Structure and Function of Plants","5MO","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to: - explain the relations between structure and function of various parts of the plant body; - describe plant structures, growth and development by making and interpreting microscopical preparations of plant parts; - recognize and describe the various types of differentiated cells and tissues of a plant; - recognize patterns of tissue formation resulting from meristem activity; - explain the basal mechanisms of the physiological processes, as well as basal ecophysiological adaptations of these processes; - explain, recognize, present and discuss the (theoretical) backgrounds of the processes that regulate growth and development of plants, both from an anatomical/cell biological and a physiological point of view; - translate the effects of environmental changes on plant growth and development (both regarding structural and physiological aspects) in plant cell biological and physiological processes; - recognize and apply methods of investigation in cell biological, anatomical and physiological studies; - design, carry out, interpret and present (in written and oral reports) experiments in the field of function, growth and development of higher plants, mostly from general prescriptions, extended with some individual set-ups.",""]
