["PPH30806","Plant Plasticity and Adaptation","6WD-2ND-HALF","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- compare the various adaptations of plants to different conditions that affect photosynthesis (e.g. low/high light, availability of water and CO2 etc.);  - discuss the role of shade avoidance in the development of plants in relation to their (competitive) environment; - explain the shoot branching response of a plant to an environmental signal based on the underlying regulation network; - compare the different survival strategies of plants to flooding, drought, desiccation, salt and extreme temperatures, as well as the evolution and diversity of various reproduction strategies, focusing on seed survival in relation to (global) climate and environment/stress.- explain and access the basis of genetic variation involved in adaptation to various types of stress, remember how natural variation occurs, how it is maintained, how it can be used for understanding physiological processes and how it can be measured; - explain the reasons for the development of high throughput phenotyping systems, name different (high throughput) phenotyping systems, understand the principles behind them and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of different phenotyping systems; - describe the evolution and diversity of different reproduction and flowering strategies, focusing on differences in strategies for pollination, fruit formation, seed dispersal and seed survival in relation to climate and environment; - formulate a research question and execute the practical experiments needed to answer this question, discuss experimental data, including statistical analysis, and report a scientific research through oral and written presentations; - formulate a research question related to an assigned topic, consult the literature needed to address this question, integrate and discuss the relevant literature and formulate an integrated conclusion, and present all this in an review article.",""]
