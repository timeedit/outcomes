["HNH37506","Metabolic Consequences of Chronic Diseases with Muscle Wasting; Nutritional and Pharmacological Intervention","6MO","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:_x000d_- explain the main mechanisms involved in disease-related changes in homeostasis and metabolism;_x000d_- define cachexia and its main characteristics;_x000d_- interpret and analyse the different pathways involved in disease or treatment induced muscle loss;_x000d_- integrate the consequences of increased intestinal permeability to inflammatory responses of the body;_x000d_- present a conference-worth oral presentation based on the concept 'take on the role of one of the presenters of the two-yearly world cachexia conference' combined with a bibliographic and pathway-specific literature search;_x000d_- apply the basic concepts of networking at conferences;_x000d_- apply knowledge on the concepts how a change in body composition as present in cachexia can influence treatment efficacy and treatment toxicity of drugs to recommendations for future research on drug treatment regimens;_x000d_- integrate and apply the discussed and self-analysed pathways to outcomes of the intensive practical training and outcomes (cell metabolic experiments) of the computer animated outcomes (simulation of animal cachexia models);_x000d_- discuss in depth above mentioned outcomes in context with current status of literature.",""]
