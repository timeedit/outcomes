["HNH37006","Data Science for Health: Principles","2MO","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to: identify challenges and opportunities, and gain insight into the added value of using data science for health research;compare relevant data sources in the field of health science, e.g. the domains relevant for the interspecialization (HNH- Global Nutrition, HNH-Nutrition and Disease, and CHL, HNH- Sensory Science and Eating Behavior, MCB, and FQD, HSO and COM);identify appropriate data pre-processing and analysis methods (e.g., predictive modeling, clustering) for these domains, based on the characteristics of the data;use R or Python as a programming language and: apply appropriate techniques for data pre-processing to the data in these different domains, apply appropriate data science algorithms to the data from these domains, apply evaluation methods appropriate for the algorithm to assess the performance of the model;discuss relevant issues regarding internal and external validation (such as selection bias, confounding);discuss and interpret the outcomes of a data science analysis and the reliability of the results;visualize and communicate results from the analysis to a multidisciplinary data science team.",""]
