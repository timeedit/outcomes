["GEN30306","Genetic Analysis Trends and Concepts","1AF, 6WD-2ND-HALF","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- explain the consequences of the soma-germline differentiation;- calculate the mutation rate, explain how it can be induced, and can evolve;- calculate the recombination rate, and explain how it can evolve;- do linkage mapping of genes and centromeres, by meiotic recombination (including tetrad analysis) and mitotic recombination;- use and explain genetic- and epigenetic concepts like: polyteny, X-chromosome inactivation, (endo-)polyploidy, aneuploidy;- use and explain evolutionary-genetics concepts like: mutation accumulation, antagonistic pleiotropy, experimental evolution, epistasis, QTLs, complementation, genetic parasites;- explain why each individual is a mutant and a recombinant.",""]
