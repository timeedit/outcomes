["ORC11806","Analytical Methods in Organic Chemistry","1AF","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- understand chromatographic theory and use this to solve problems;- understand spectroscopic theory and use this to solve problems;- apply (theoretically and practically) various extraction, sample clean-up, and chromatographic techniques to separate compounds;- appraise published analytical procedures and explain the logic behind them;- apply sample preparation and spectroscopic techniques to obtain spectra from compounds;- interpret recorded spectra and propose a chemical structure based on those data;- prepare and have an oral discussion on the chromatography practical sessions;- prepare a written spectroscopy report that summarizes and discusses collected data in a clear fashion.",""]
