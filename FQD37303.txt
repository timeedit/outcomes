["FQD37303","Predicting Food Quality - Theoretical principles of modelling","2DL-1ST-HALF","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:        _x000d_- explain and infer the nature of food quality attributes in relation to food quality;_x000d_- classify and infer food quality attribute changes from thermodynamic and kinetic principles;_x000d_- calculate uncertainties in parameters and predictions in case of kinetic models;_x000d_- practice with the nature and properties of mathematical equations relevant for food quality;_x000d_- assess competing models on their ability to predict.",""]
