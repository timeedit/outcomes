["BIP32803","Biophysical Imaging","4MO","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to: •    explain the basic principles of four spectroscopic methods for imaging of biological or food-related systems:  - Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM);  - Laser Scanning Microscopy (LSM);  - Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI);  - Single-Molecule Localisation Microscopy (SMLM).•    apply these techniques knowing their particular limitations and strengths (achievable spatial resolution, contrast, information content and possible applications);•    understand and apply suitable image and data processing techniques;•    interpret the results in terms of (spatial and dynamic) information.",""]
