["PCC13803","General Chemistry 2 MLS","2AF-1ST-HALF","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- analyze and examine aspects of chemical mass transport (friction, drift, flux, diffusion, ionic mobility) and apply these to topics like Fickâ€™s first law, membrane potentials and electrical conductance of a solution;- analyze and examine aspects of electrochemistry (half reactions, electrochemical cells oxidation numbers, Nernst equation) and apply these to topics like spontaneity of chemical reactions, electrode potentials, equilibrium constants of electrochemical reactions and concentration measurements;- outline the principles of the quantum mechanical model for single and multi-electron atoms and connect these to trends in the periodic table of elements and topics like the aufbau principle, atomic orbitals and energy levels in atoms;- construct Lewis structures of simple inorganic molecules and classify  their shapes using the VSEPR model;- apply Lambert Beer's law and understand absorption and emission of electromagnetic radiation;- apply the concepts of energy levels, partition functions and corresponding molar quantities to molecules;- execute experiments in the domain of general and physical chemistry following a given protocol and analyze the outcomes.",""]
