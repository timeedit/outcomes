["CSA32806","Modelling functional diversity in crop production","4WD","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:explain how the evolution of plant traits relates to competition for resources between individual plants;explain how plants interact and adapt their competitiveness depending on the identity of neighbouring plants;explain how community ecological processes can determine population species composition over time;explain why improvements in crop performance and resource use efficiency associated to species diversity can result from interactions between species and competition for resources;explain how the quantitative characterization of intra and interspecific competition among plant species relates to a descriptive model on yield loss due to weeds;explain the principle and suitability of a range of strategies aiming a reduced use of herbicides for weed control;explain how two advanced crop modelling techniques can help analysing the role of plant competition in crop performance;translate theoretical concepts into concrete scientific questions, hypotheses and meaningful experiments;integrate knowledge on plant interactions using plant growth modelling, and interpret model output on plant interactions and competition;communicate the contents of a scientific study in a simulated conference setting using a clear and attractive poster and to present this poster with condensed information;analyse how diversity in weed management measures, including crop diversification, contributes to a sustainable management of weed populations, using weed demographic modelling.",""]
