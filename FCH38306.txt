["FCH38306","Molecular Signatures of Biofunctional Food Ingredients","2MO","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- Explain why ingredients with similar chemical structure can have different bio-functionality;- Explain the molecular mechanism of biofunctional food ingredients;- Recognize important challenges and limitations for the application of biofunctional ingredients;- Explain basic principles of molecular modelling and chemometrics;- Design and evaluate a quantitative model for predicting the structure-function relationships of (new) biofunctional ingredients;- Design an in-silico experiment to decide which ingredient potentially provides the best biofunctionality.",""]
