["ORC31303","Research Methods in Organic Chemistry","3MO","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- perform, set up and monitor advanced organic chemistry experiments in a safe way using conditions like low temperatures (-78Â°C), exclusion of air and moisture, or use of highly reactive reagents;- obtain the pure reaction product(s) by using appropriate isolation and purification techniques like extraction, chromatography and/or recrystallization;- identify the structure of the product(s) by recording and interpreting relevant spectra and determining and comparing its physical properties;- explain the experimental approach and outcome of reactions by describing and explaining the reaction mechanism and consulting literature sources;- present experimental results and theory in a written report.",""]
