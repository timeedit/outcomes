["AFI51306","Circularity in Aquatic Food Production","3WD","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:- outline the challenges and opportunities for seaweed and shellfish production in the context of circular aquatic food systems- discuss how circular aquatic food production contributes to sustainable global food production- summarize a number of farm-ecosystem interactions and understand how Cumulative Environmental Impact Assessments are used to evaluate these interactions- explain how environmental factors drive the physiology and ecological functioning of micro-algae, seaweed and shellfish and how this varies between natural and IMTA systems- establish and explain nutrient balances of seaweeds and other low trophic species in mono-culture and in Integrated Multi Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) systems and define nutrient turnover efficiencies- integrate the disciplines of low trophic production, circularity, sustainability, and IMTA as a whole in societal, economic and ecological value creation",""]
